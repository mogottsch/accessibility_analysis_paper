  abstract = {This paper proposes multiple extensions to the popular bicriterion transit routing approach -- Trip-Based Transit Routing (TBTR). Specifically, building on the premise of the HypRAPTOR algorithm, we first extend TBTR to its partitioning variant -- HypTBTR. However, the improvement in query times of HyTBTR over TBTR comes at the cost of increased preprocessing. To counter this issue, two new techniques are proposed -- a One-To-Many variant of TBTR and multilevel partitioning. Our One-To-Many algorithm can rapidly solve profile queries, which not only reduces the preprocessing time for HypTBTR, but can also aid other popular approaches such as HypRAPTOR. Next, we integrate a multilevel graph partitioning paradigm in HypTBTR and HypRAPTOR to reduce the fill-in computations. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is extensively tested on real-world large-scale datasets. Additional analysis studying the effect of hypergraph partitioning tools (hMETIS, KaHyPar, and an integer program) along with different weighting schemes is also presented.},

  abstract = {Transfer pattern routing is a state-of-the-art speed-up technique for finding optimal paths which minimize multiple cost criteria in public transportation networks. It precomputes sequences of transfer stations along optimal paths. At query time, the optimal paths are searched among the stored transfer patterns, which allows for very fast response times even on very large networks. On the other hand, even a minor change to the timetables may affect many optimal paths, so that, in principle, a new computation of all optimal transfer patterns becomes necessary. In this paper, we examine the robustness of transfer pattern routing towards delay, which is the most common source of such updates. The intuition is that the deviating paths caused by typical updates are already covered by original transfer patterns. We perform experiments which show that the transfer patterns are remarkably robust even to large and many delays, which underlines the applicability and reliability of transfer pattern routing in realistic routing applications.},

For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in milliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide different trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and query time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond, while others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on public transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a significantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and multicriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive queries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances requires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning problem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation~(buses, trains) with unrestricted modes~(walking, driving), is even harder, relying on approximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.},

The objective is to compute Pareto-optimal journeys with respect to arrival time and the number of used public transit trips. While various existing algorithms can efficiently compute optimal journeys in either a pure public transit network or a pure transfer graph, combining the two increases running times significantly. Existing approaches therefore typically only support limited walking between stops, either by imposing a maximum transfer distance or by requiring the transfer graph to be transitively closed. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel preprocessing technique called ULTRA (UnLimited TRAnsfers): Given an unlimited transfer graph, which may represent any non-schedule-based transportation mode, ULTRA computes a small number of transfer shortcuts that are provably sufficient for computing a Pareto set of optimal journeys. These transfer shortcuts can be integrated into a variety of state-of-the-art public transit algorithms, establishing the ULTRA-Query algorithm family. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that ULTRA improves these algorithms from limited to unlimited transfers without sacrificing query speed. This is true not just for walking, but also for faster transfer modes such as bicycle or car. Compared to the state of the art for multimodal journey planning, the fastest ULTRA-based algorithm achieves a speedup of an order of magnitude.},

We consider the distribution of the number of visits to the doctor and, in particular, we model its dependence on a number of demographic factors. Examination of the Australian 1995 National Health Survey data reveals that generalized linear Poisson or negative binomial models are inadequate for modelling the mean as a function of covariates, because of excessive zero counts, and a mean-variance relationship that varies enormously over covariate values. A negative binomial model is used, with parameter values estimated in subgroups according to the discrete combinations of the covariate values. Smoothing splines are then used to smooth and interpolate the parameter values. In effect the mean and the shape parameters are each modelled as (different) functions of gender, age and geographical factors. The estimated regressions for the mean have simple and intuitive interpretations. However, the dependence of the (negative binomial) shape parameter on the covariates is more difficult to interpret and is subject to influence by extreme observations. We illustrate the use of the model by estimating the distribution of the number of doctor consultations in the Statistical Local Area of Ryde, based on population numbers from the 1996 census.},

Seldom included are other travel options such as carpooling, carsharing, or bikesharing, as well as the possibility to compute personalized results tailored to the specific needs and preferences of the individual user. Partially, this is due to the fact that the inclusion of various modes of transportation and user requirements quickly leads to complex, semantically enriched graph structures, which to a certain degree impede downstream procedures such as dynamic graph updates or route queries. In this paper, we aim to reduce the computational effort and specification complexity of personalized multi-modal routing by use of a preceding heuristic, which, based on information stored in a user profile, derives a set of feasible candidate travel options, which can then be evaluated by a traditional routing algorithm. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed system with two practical examples.},

  abstract = {A method for evaluating transit planning proposals using accessibility metrics is advanced in this research. A transit-accessibility model is developed intended for use by in-house transit agency planning staff as a preliminary project design and evaluation tool. It relies on readily available socioeconomic and travel data and a GIS-supported representation of the transit network. It is intended to inform planning decisions using transparent and intuitive models in a less time consuming and expensive manner than more elaborate and comprehensive planning methods. Emphasis is placed on the visualization of changes in transit level of service resulting from major facility investments. In this capacity, the accessibility metric can assist in identifying the potential ridership change and development impacts of a project. The accessibility model relies on the travel-time outputs of a transit network model, socio-economic data and information on current travel patterns. Development of a network model of transit service in the Chicago region with a focus on CTA bus and rapid transit and METRA commuter rail service is documented. The network model is intended to support on-going research, beyond the scope of this thesis, as part of the collaborative Chicago Transit Authority-MIT research effort. The impact of the proposed Circle Line rail project on employment access and commercial development potential is analyzed to illustrate the potential of the accessibility metric. The model is also applied as a sketch planning tool for intermediate stations on proposed Airport Express trains between downtown Chicago and its two major airports.},

Capturing this variation increases complexity, slowing calculations. This paper presents new methods for rapid yet rigorous computation of accessibility metrics, allowing immediate feedback during early-stage transit planning while being rigorous enough for final analyses. The approach is statistical, characterizing the uncertainty and variability in accessibility metrics related to differences in departure time and headway-based scenario specification. The analysis was carried out on a detailed multimodal network model including both public transportation and streets. Land use data were represented at high resolution. These methods were implemented as open-source software running on a commodity cloud infrastructure. Networks were constructed from standard open data sources, and scenarios were built in a map-based web interface. A case study is presented, describing how these methods were applied in a long-term transportation planning process for an urbanized, polycentric Randstad region in the Netherlands.},

It is difficult to include fares in shortest-path algorithms because fares are often path-dependent. When fare policies allow discounted transfers, for example, the fare for a given journey segment depends on characteristics of previous journey segments. Existing methods to characterize tradeoffs between travel time and monetary cost objectives do not scale well to complex networks, or they rely on approximations. Additionally, they often require assumed values of time, which may be problematic for evaluating the equity of service provision. We propose a new method that allows us to find Pareto sets of paths, jointly minimizing fare and travel time. Using a case study in greater Boston, Massachusetts, USA, we test the algorithm's performance as part of an interactive web application for computing accessibility metrics. Potential extensions for journey planning and route choice models are also discussed.},

Existing algorithms consider this as a graph problem and solve it using various graph search algorithms. Unfortunately, this leads to either high query times or suboptimal solutions. We take a different approach. We introduce RAPTOR, our novel round-based public transit router. Unlike previous algorithms, it is not Dijkstra-based, looks at each route (such as a bus line) in the network at most once per round, and can be made even faster with simple pruning rules and parallelization using multiple cores. Because it does not rely on preprocessing, RAPTOR works in fully dynamic scenarios. Starting from arrival time and number of transfers as criteria, it can be easily extended to handle flexible departure times or arbitrary additional criteria. As practical examples we consider fare zones and reliability of transfers. When run on complex public transportation networks (such as London), RAPTOR computes all Pareto-optimal journeys between two random locations an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches, which easily enables interactive applications.},

  abstract = {In the multimodal route planning problem, we are given multiple transportation networks (e.g., pedestrian, road, public transit) and ask for a best integrated journey between two points. The main challenge is that a seemingly optimal journey may have changes between networks that do not reflect the user's modal preferences. In fact, quickly computing reasonable multimodal routes remains a challenging problem: previous approaches either suffer from poor query performance or their available choices of modal preferences during query time is limited. In this work, we focus on computing exact multimodal journeys that can be restricted by specifying arbitrary modal sequences at query time. For example, a user can say whether he or she wants to only use public transit, prefers to also use a taxi or walking at the beginning or end of the journey, or has no restrictions at all. By carefully adapting node contraction, a common ingredient to many speedup techniques on road networks, we are able to compute point-to-point queries on a continental network combined of cars, railroads, and flights several orders of magnitude faster than Dijkstra's algorithm. Thereby, we require little space overhead and obtain fast preprocessing times.},

Furthermore, a Data Mining approach is introduced, allowing for a substantial reduction of the volume of input data required for city logistics routing. The different approaches are investigated and evaluated by a huge amount of FCD collected for the urban area of Stuttgart, Germany. The results show that the Data Mining approach enables efficient provision of time-dependent travel times without a significant loss of routing quality for city logistics applications.},

Accessibility indicates the collective performance of land use and transportation systems and determines how well that complex system serves its residents. This research project comprises three main tasks. The first task reviews the literature on accessibility and its performance measures with an emphasis on measures that planners and decision makers can understand and replicate. The second task identifies the appropriate measures of accessibility, where accessibility measures are evaluated in terms of ease of understanding, accuracy and complexity, while the third task illustrates these accessibility measures. During this process a new accessibility measure named 'Place Rank' is introduced as an accurate measure of accessibility. In addition, several previously-defined accessibility measures are reviewed and demonstrated in this report including cumulative opportunity and gravity-based measures. The gravity-based measure is widely used in the literature yet cumulative opportunity tends to be easier to understand and interpret by the public, planners, and administrators. A major contribution of this research is the comparison of accessibility measures over time and among various modes. Effects of accessibility on home sales are also tested. Homebuyers pay a premium to live near jobs and away from competing workers. Accessibility promises to be a useful tool for monitoring the land use and transportation system, and assessing and valuing the benefits of proposed changes to either land use or networks.},

  abstract = {Social equity is increasingly incorporated as a long-term objective into urban transportation plans. Researchers use accessibility measures to assess equity issues, such as determining the amount of jobs reachable by marginalized groups within a defined travel time threshold and compare these measures across socioeconomic categories. However, allocating public transit resources in an equitable manner is not only related to travel time, but also related to the out-of-pocket cost of transit, which can represent a major barrier to accessibility for many disadvantaged groups. Therefore, this research proposes a set of new accessibility measures that incorporates both travel time and transit fares. It then applies those measures to determine whether people residing in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada experience the same levels of transit accessibility as those living in other neighborhoods. Results are presented in terms of regional accessibility and trends by social indicator decile. Travel time accessibility measures estimate a higher number of jobs that can be reached compared to combined travel time and cost measures. However, the degree and impact of these measures varies across the social deciles. Compared to other groups in the region, residents of socially disadvantaged areas have more equitable accessibility to jobs using transit; this is reflected in smaller decreases in accessibility when fare costs are included. Generating new measures of accessibility combining travel time and transit fares provides more accurate measures that can be easily communicated by transportation planners and engineers to policy makers and the public since it translates accessibility measures to a dollar value.},

Most solutions are, however, tailored to either road or public transit networks in isolation. To fully exploit the transportation infrastructure, multimodal algorithms are sought to compute shortest paths combining various modes of transportation. Nonetheless, current solutions still lack performance to efficiently handle interactive queries under realistic network conditions where traffic jams, public transit cancelations, or delays often occur. We present a multimodal separators\textendash based algorithm (MUSE), a new multimodal algorithm based on graph separators to compute shortest travel time paths. It partitions the network into independent, smaller regions, enabling fast and scalable preprocessing. The partition is common to all modes and independent of traffic conditions so that the preprocessing is only executed once. MUSE relies on a state automaton that describes the sequence of modes to constrain the shortest path during the preprocessing and the online phase. The support of new sequences of mobility modes only requires the preprocessing of the cliques, independently for each partition. We also augment our algorithm with heuristics during the query phase to achieve further speedups with minimal effect on correctness. We provide experimental results on France's multimodal network containing the pedestrian, road, bicycle, and public transit networks.},

Despite the interest raised by the concept, and other variants of chrono-urbanism, to date, only a few studies have evaluated cities from the FMC perspective. Most studies on the subject also lack a proper well-defined methodology that can properly assess FMC conditions. In this context, this study contributes to the development of an appropriate FMC-measuring method by using network analysis for services and activities in the City of Barcelona (Catalonia, northeastern Spain). By using network analyst and basing our analysis on cadastral parcels, this study is able to detail the overall accessibility conditions of the city and its urban social functions based on the FMC perspective. The resulting spatial synthetic index is enhanced with the creation of partial indexes measuring the impact of education, provisioning, entertainment, public and non-motorized transport, and care facilities. The results show that most residents of this dense and compact city live in areas with proximity to services, that can clearly be labeled as FMC, although there are some shortfalls in peripheral areas. Results validate the FMC methodology as a viable method to highlight spatial inequalities at the microscale level, a valuable tool for the development of effective planning policies.},

This synthesis represents a critically needed evaluation of the current state of global bike share research, in order to better understand, and maximize the effectiveness of current and future programs. Several consistent themes have emerged within the growing body of research on bike share programs. Firstly, the importance bike share members place on convenience and value for money appears paramount in their motivation to sign up and use these programs. Secondly, and somewhat counter intuitively, scheme members are more likely to own and use private bicycles than nonmembers. Thirdly, users demonstrate a greater reluctance to wear helmets than private bicycle riders and helmets have acted as a deterrent in jurisdictions in which helmets are mandatory. Finally, and perhaps most importantly from a sustainable transport perspective, the majority of scheme users are substituting from sustainable modes of transport rather than the car.},

A renewed concept of urban accessibility, together with the redefinition of public spaces and "soft" ways of moving (pedestrian and cycle) to reach neighbourhood services, represent a starting point not only from which to face new challenges but also to rediscover the sense of community, especially at the neighbourhood scale. The 15-minute city draws its origins from the concept of the "neighbourhood unit", developed in 1923 in a competition for the city of Chicago, to define compact residential neighbourhoods where the proximity between services and homes contributed to set out the identity character of that part of the city and to create "the sense of belonging" of a community to a place. The events of the last year strongly re-propose experimentation with this approach, also following the proposal by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, aimed at giving a new face to Paris starting from the creation of extensive pedestrian green areas on the large boulevards that are now crossed by the cars and, therefore, to allow the inhabitants to reach, by walking, essential urban services within the 15-minute threshold. Other cities, such as New York and Milan, have also begun to work to make their neighbourhoods, especially peripheral ones, accessible in 15 minutes on foot or by bicycle, without neglecting the goal of transforming these neighbourhoods into attractive places for social gathering for local communities. In this perspective, the research work aims at identifying the urban characteristics that define a 15-minute city, starting from the cities that are launching this experimentation. Among the urban characteristics, the geomorphological, physical (concerning both the spaces and the paths, such as the geometry of the pedestrian and cycle networks), functional (distribution and location of services), socio-economic (of the population) and settlement ones are taken into consideration. According to the weights of the variables identified as significant, the work defines different areas accessible in 15 minutes based on users' willingness to walk and the geomorphological, physical, settlement and functional characteristics identified in each urban area. The work is carried out in selected districts of the city of Naples which, due to their demographic, morphological and settlement characteristics, make them a significant area of experimentation.},

In this paper we formally define isochrones for multimodal spatial networks with different transportation modes that can be discrete or continuous in, respectively, space and time. For the computation of isochrones we propose the multimodal incremental network expansion (MINE) algorithm, which is independent of the actual network size and depends only on the size of the isochrone. An empirical study using real-world data confirms the analytical results.},

We review some previous approximate treatments of this problem that indicate that the optimal distribution of facilities should have a density that increases with population density, but does so slower than linearly, as the two-thirds power. We confirm this result numerically for the particular case of the United States with recent population data using two independent methods, one a straightforward regression analysis, the other based on density-dependent map projections. We also consider strategies for linking the facilities to form a spatial network, such as a network of flights between airports, so that the combined cost of maintenance of and travel on the network is minimized. We show specific examples of such optimal networks for the case of the United States.},

A hierarchy is then generated by iteratively contracting the least important node. Contracting a node v means replacing shortest paths going through v by shortcuts. We obtain a hierarchical query algorithm using bidirectional shortest-path search. The forward search uses only edges leading to more important nodes and the backward search uses only edges coming from more important nodes. For fastest routes in road networks, the graph remains very sparse throughout the contraction process using rather simple heuristics for ordering the nodes. We have five times lower query times than the best previous hierarchical Dijkstra-based speedup techniques and a negative space overhead, i.e., the data structure for distance computation needs less space than the input graph. CHs can be combined with many other route planning techniques, leading to improved performance for many-to-many routing, transit-node routing, goal-directed routing or mobile and dynamic scenarios.},

During a preprocessing step, we exploit the inherent hierarchical structure of road networks by adding shortcut edges. A subsequent modified bidirectional Dijkstra algorithm can then find a shortest path in a fraction of a millisecond, visiting only a few hundred nodes. This small search space makes it suitable to implement it on a mobile device. We present a mobile implementation that also handles changes in the road network, like traffic jams, and that allows instantaneous routing without noticeable delay for the user. Also, an algorithm to calculate large distance tables is currently the fastest if based on contraction hierarchies.},

How can the economic benefits associated with accessibility changes be measured? What are the accessibility benefits of having a public transport service available as a transport option for unexpected future use? How can the land-use, transport and accessibility impacts of Dutch compact urbanisation policies implemented in the last decades be measured? The research presented in this thesis seeks to answer these and related questions. Results suggest that current practices in evaluating accessibility in the Netherlands can be improved using geographical accessibility measures within an integrated land-use/transport perspective. Another major outcome is formed by the possible significant benefits associated with option use of public transport services in addition to use and non-use benefits traditionally included in transport policy appraisal. Residents in the service area of regional railway links seemed to be willing to pay significant amounts for the continued availability of the railway links for unexpected future use. Dutch compact urbanisation policies were also shown to have contributed to the land-use and transport-related intentions of the Dutch national government. Without compact urban development urban sprawl would likely have been greater, resulting in greater car use and related environmental impacts, higher congestion and lower accessibility levels, along with stronger fragmentation of wildlife habitats.},

The climate projections and scenarios assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, following the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)-Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) framework, have provided a rich understanding of the constraints and opportunities for policy action. However, the current emissions scenarios lack an explicit treatment of urban emissions within the global context. Given the pace and scale of urbanization, with global urban populations expected to increase from about 4.4 billion today to about 7 billion by 2050, there is an urgent need to fill this knowledge gap. Here, we estimate the share of global GHG emissions emanating from urban areas from 1990 to 2100 based on the SSP-RCP framework. The urban GHG emissions are presented in five regional aggregates and are based on a combination of the urban population share, 2015 urban per capita CO2eq emissions, SSP-based national CO2eq emissions, and recent analysis of urban per capita CO2eq trends. We find that urban areas account for the majority of global GHG emissions in 2015 (61.8\%). Moreover, the urban share of global GHG emissions progressively increases into the future, exceeding 80\% in some scenarios by the end of the century. The combined urban areas in Asia and Developing Pacific, and Developed Countries account for 65.0\% to 73.3\% of cumulative urban emissions between 2020 and 2100 across the scenarios. Given these dominant roles, we describe the implications to potential urban mitigation in each of the scenario narratives in order to meet the goal of climate neutrality within this century.},

A forerunner in transit reform, the city of Bogot\'a, Colombia, first implemented the TransMilenio bus rapid transit (BRT) system and then more recently undertook a large-scale initiative to formalize and regulate traditional urban buses in the city. This integrated public transport system [Sistema Integrado de Transporte P\'ublico (SITP)] is transforming Bogot\'a's traditional urban bus system into a regulated, concessionary system with restructured bus routes that integrates operations, fares, and infrastructure with the TransMilenio BRT. An investigation was conducted to determine whether the SITP has increased affordability and employment accessibility for public transit users in Bogot\'a. Results revealed that most accessibility improvements resulted from the recent expansion (and significantly higher speeds) of TransMilenio rather than the SITP. Results of an analysis conducted with budget constraints to determine affordable accessibility indicated that employment accessibility was reduced overall; however, the new integrated fare increased accessibility over traditional buses, especially on the periphery and in southern areas of the city, as a result of reduced transfer costs. Overall, results partly explain the lack of enthusiasm for the bus reform process on the part of public transit users and the political discomfort that becomes apparent when embarking on this process in developing-world cities. Also, more incremental, flexible reform might be crafted for public transportation systems that are dominated by informal services.},

Using a case study of Toronto, we specify both origin-based and regional-scale analysis scenarios and find significant differences in computation time and calculated accessibilities. While the calculated travel time matrices are highly correlated across tools, each tool produces different results for the same origin-destination pair. Comparisons of the estimated accessibilities also reveal evidence of spatial clustering in the ways paths are calculated by some tools relative to others at different locations around the city.

Denmark had the largest share of persons who saw their generalist practitioner 6 times or more (49\%) during the previous 12 months, while France had the highest percentage of people (34\%) going to the doctor 3 to 5 times. The share of persons consulting their doctor once or twice was largest in Slovakia (47\%) and the share of persons who did not go to see the doctor was highest in Greece (61\%).  \ldots a dentist? 45\% of people in the EU did not consult a dentist in the 12 months prior to the survey, while 42\% went once or twice to a dentist. 10\% reported that they went to a dentist 3 to 5 times, and 3\% 6 times or more.

  abstract = {Having car drivers switch to using public transit would greatly benefit the transport system in many cities and reduce the negative environmental impact that comes with having many vehicles on the road. However, the convenience, speed and comfort achieved from using a private vehicle is seen as one of the major reasons why travellers prefer their cars. On-demand services especially when combined with the transit system have been proposed as a way forward. Yet, there are a few findings on how or where this service would be beneficial to car drivers.  In this study we model the integration of an on-demand service with public transit with the aim to find where there is potential for drivers to use transit. We also present a fleet performance measure for determining an efficient fleet size that would serve this system. Our findings show that public transit can be improved, decreasing travel time by 21\% on average, especially for drivers whose trips originate at the fringes of the city. We also show what fleet operational choices are more efficient in terms of vehicle placement and fleet sizes.},

  abstract = {The 15~min city (or ``X-minute city'' in general) concept aims to give people access to all essential services and daily needs (e.g., healthcare, education, etc.) within X minutes of active transportation, to improve transport equity, sustainability, and traffic safety. To date, there is a lack of methods and tools to assess to what degree cities currently, or after implementing policies, comply with the X-minute city concept. This research aims to develop a methodology for quantifying the X-minute city through a metric (CSx) that was developed based on an accessibility framework and tested for cycling mode in the Utrecht region in the Netherlands as a study area. Travel data from the Netherlands mobility panel were analysed to determine input characteristics of the metric, such as the weight of destination types. Standardized gravity-based 2-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) accessibility scores for all destination types were weighted and aggregated into a composite metric that shows relative scores as an X-minute city. The results of the analysis show that 100\% of the population in the Utrecht region has access to at least one destination for all 9 destination types within 15~min, whereas this number reduces to 94\% within a 10~min cycling threshold; indicating the status of Utrecht as a cycling city with cycling-friendly infrastructure. Furthermore, low-income groups do not have lower cycling accessibility to the services in the 15~min city in the study area, reinforcing the notion that cycling can be an effective solution to reduce transport inequalities. The developed metric can be used to assess cities on their way towards becoming X-minute city, prioritise neighbourhoods to develop, set quantifiable goals, and evaluate planning scenarios.},

Our approach is based on highway hierarchies, which are also used for the currently fastest speedup techniques for shortest path queries in road networks. We show how to use highway hierarchies so that for example, a 10 000 \texttimes{} 10 000 distance table in the European road network can be computed in about one minute. These results are based on a simple basic idea, several refinements, and careful engineering of the approach. We also explain how the approach can be parallelized and how the computation can be restricted to computing only the k closest connections.},

  abstract = {We explore the feasibility of limiting global warming to 1.5\textdegree C without overshoot and without the deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies. For this purpose, we perform a sensitivity analysis of four generic emissions reduction measures to identify a lower bound on future CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes. Final energy demand reductions and electrification of energy end uses as well as decarbonization of electricity and non-electric energy supply are all considered. We find the lower bound of cumulative fossil fuel and industry CO2 emissions to be 570 GtCO2 for the period 2016\textendash 2100, around 250 GtCO2 lower than the lower end of available 1.5\textdegree C mitigation pathways generated with integrated assessment models. Estimates of 1.5\textdegree C-consistent CO2 budgets are highly uncertain and range between 100 and 900 GtCO2 from 2016 onwards. Based on our sensitivity analysis, limiting warming to 1.5\textdegree C will require CDR or terrestrial net carbon uptake if 1.5\textdegree C-consistent budgets are smaller than 650 GtCO2. The earlier CDR is deployed, the more it neutralizes post-2020 emissions rather than producing net negative emissions. Nevertheless, if the 1.5\textdegree C budget is smaller than 550 GtCO2, temporary overshoot of the 1.5\textdegree C limit becomes unavoidable if CDR cannot be ramped up faster than to 4 GtCO2 in 2040 and 10 GtCO2 in 2050.

  abstract = {This paper describes a new method to compute isochrones in multimodal spatial networks, which aims at finding a good trade-off between memory usage and runtime. In the past, approaches based on Dijkstra's algorithm have been proposed. For small networks, the entire network is first loaded in main memory, where the network is expanded to determine the isochrone. For large networks that do not fit in main memory, approaches that load the network vertex-by-vertex during the expansion phase have been proposed. They keep the memory footprint minimal, but have to query the database for each node in the isochrone, which can be very time consuming. The method presented in this paper uses tiles (which are well known from interactive online maps) to realize chunk-loading of vertices by utilizing so-called tile regions. This approach significantly reduces the number of database requests, while keeping the memory usage low. Our method is able to compute isochrones even in large networks at a reasonable time. An experimental evaluation shows that the new algorithm clearly outperforms previous competitive approaches such as MINE and MINEX.},

  abstract = {Striving to reflect on the significance and comprehensiveness of access applications, we collected 19 chapters covering access research in seven main categories to illustrate the state-of-the-art of access applications along distinct dimensions of transport studies.     Our chapters cover access research at the international, national, metropolitan, and city levels. American cities are studied in chapter 3, chapter 4, chapter 11, chapter 14, chapter 16, chapter 18, and chapter 19. International cases are assessed and compared in chapter 2 and chapter 17, while chapter 9 examines Munich, Germany and chapter 13 analyzes Jakarta, Indonesia.     Chapters are grouped into seven informal and overlapping categories:     Equity and social justice:     In chapter 2, Santos and Boisjoly discuss a series of case studies that display a growing concern for transport equity. They suggest that professionals and policymakers can adopt access-based approaches to foster social inclusion through equitable transport policies. In chapter 3, Palmateer and Levinson evaluate potential measures of distributive justice based on the access to jobs provided by various modes and offer recommendations for appropriate use of each measure. In chapter 4, Borowski, Ermagun, and Levinson explore the relation between transit-based job access and minority races and ethnicities, low- and middle-income households, and carless households at the block group level for the 50 most populated metropolitan areas in the United States. The analyses show that access is unevenly distributed across metropolitan regions across the US when considering various socio-demographic populations. Different metropolitan regions provide different levels of access for all investigated socio-demographic categories, whether considering racial minorities, levels of income, or car ownership.     Resilience and crisis:     In chapter 5, DeWeese, Manaugh, and El-Geneidy show how access can be used as a rapid diagnostic tool to assess the potential impacts of public transport service adjustments during a public health crisis. In chapter 6, Ghorbanzadeh, Kim, Ozguven, and Horner assess the spatial access of US census population block groups to congregate and non-congregate shelters in Northwest Florida. They argue that many areas in Northwest Florida have lower access to non-congregate shelters compared to congregate shelters.     Active transport:     In chapter 7, Murphy, Owen, and Levinson predict pedestrian activity using scalable and transferable predictive variables. They show that access to jobs by walking and transit, automobile traffic, and specific economic job categories (Education, Finance) are significant predictors of increased pedestrian traffic. In contrast, access to other economic job categories (Management, Utilities) significantly predict decreased pedestrian traffic. In chapter 8, Schoner and Levinson study people's navigation from place to place using the Nice Ride Minnesota bikeshare system in Minneapolis. The results indicate people prefer to use stations that do not require long detours out of the way to access. However, commuters and non-work travelers differ in how they value the walking portion of their trip and what station amenities and neighborhood features increase a station's utility. In chapter 9, Duran-Rodas, Nichols, and B\"uttner conducted a spatial fairness assessment to analyze which social groups are favored with active access to Urban E-commerce Infrastructure (UEI) in Munich and claim that e-commerce infrastructure benefits the cosmopolitan population, regardless of social status.     Public transport:     In chapter 10, Zeng, Song, and Chen present methods and procedures to evaluate grocery store spatio-temporal access considering coupled constraints of transit schedules and store opening hours. The findings suggest that decision-makers need to consider the variations in access levels across different spatial locations, times of the day, and social groups within various living-built environments. In chapter 11, Guthrie and Fan explore the ability of transit systems in regions to provide post-secondary education and job placement services destinations for marginalized workers. Their results provide compelling evidence for the social equity benefits of regional transit investments and the importance of integrated transit, land use, and regional public service planning.     Auto travel:     In chapter 12, Huang and Levinson examine the impact of land use around the home on vehicle trip generation and identify the correlation of trips made by the same individual in the trip generation models. The results indicate that although access around the home is not found to have statistically significant effects on non-work vehicle trips, the diversity of services within 10 to 15 minutes and 15 to 20 minutes from home can help reduce the number of non-work vehicle trips. In chapter 13, Andani, Paix, Rachmat, Syabri, and Geurs describe an evaluation of the job access and spatial equity impacts of the Cipularang toll road in the Jakarta \textendash{} Bandung corridor in Indonesia. The analysis reveals that the construction of the toll road has reduced travel time in the whole region by 13\%, and potential job access increased by 5\%.     System performance:     In chapter 14, Ermagun and Levinson disentangle the impacts of financial and physical dimensions of transit service operators on net transit access. The results indicate that using the same operating expenses for both bus and train services, the bus system provides roughly 6 times more access than the train system. The bus system also operates 4 times more efficiently than the train system, providing access with the same frequency. In chapter 15, Iacono, Cao, Cui, and Levinson investigate the relation between urban access and firm agglomeration, as reflected in patterns of employment densities. They argue that urbanization effects tend to overshadow those of localization effects. These effects vary by sector, with many service-based sectors showing a stronger propensity to agglomerate than manufacturing and several ``basic'' sectors like agriculture, mining, and utilities. In chapter 16, Janatabadi, Tajik, and Ermagun study the spatial and temporal disparity of modal access to employment in Chicago and its nine neighborhoods. The findings alert urban planners and policymakers on the effects of travel time and space on access analysis. They also explain how inaccurate perceptions of transit performance prevent the development of an effective and equitable transit system.     Project evaluation:     In chapter 17, Stewart and Byrd evaluate how interactive tools for calculating and visualizing indicators of access to opportunities can facilitate more integrated metropolitan planning. In chapter 18, Palmateer, Ermagun, Owen, and Levinson examine the importance of service area definition when utilizing access-based evaluation in transit projects. The results indicate that the choice of transit service areas significantly impacts the value of absolute access measures. In chapter 19, Palmateer, Owen, and Ermagun use the access-based evaluation method to unpack the interaction effect of transit-oriented development and a new transit hub using the San Francisco Transbay Transit Center Development Plan project. This indicates that in areas where there already is transit service, the development of land near the transit service can have a greater impact on access levels than the improvement of connections between transit services. The book ends in chapter 20 with a review by Jin, Cheng, and Witlox of how virtual access interacts with physical access and how the interaction affects travel-access relations in the future.},

On current trends, the probability of staying below 2\,\textdegree C of warming is only 5\%, but if all countries meet their nationally determined contributions and continue to reduce emissions at the same rate after 2030, it rises to 26\%. If the USA alone does not meet its nationally determined contribution, it declines to 18\%. To have an even chance of staying below 2\,\textdegree C, the average rate of decline in emissions would need to increase from the 1\% per year needed to meet the nationally determined contributions, to 1.8\% per year.},

The 10, 15, or 20-minute city or neighbourhood \textemdash{} which, for generality, we refer to as the x-minute city \textemdash{} is a type of design aimed at reducing car dependence by enabling urban residents to walk or cycle to essential amenities within x minutes from their home. Due to the benefits which include sustainability, health, and social cohesion, the concept has been promoted by the international C40 Cities as part of their post-pandemic Green and Just Recovery Agenda. However, missing from the current rhetoric around these ``cities of proximity'' is clear guidance on evaluating progress towards this goal. In this paper, we contrast measurement approaches and discuss important considerations for planners adopting the x-minute city goal. To do this, we measure the proximity of the 500 largest cities in the USA and 43 urban areas of New Zealand. We also present an interactive tool to visualise and explore proximity within the urban areas.},

  abstract = {Bicycle-sharing programs have emerged around the world. Theoretically, the effect of bicycle sharing on more conventional transit modes can take a substitute or complementary form. On one hand, bicycle sharing could substitute for conventional transit as a convenient and sustainable travel option. On the other hand, bicycle sharing may complement such transit by seamlessly connecting transit stations with origins and destinations and thus increase accessibility. However, the questions of how and to what extent bicycle-sharing programs affect public transit ridership remain to be answered, despite the attempts of a few empirical and quantitative studies. This study examined the impact of the Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) program on Metrorail's ridership in Washington, D.C. When CaBi trips were mapped, it was observed that Metrorail stations had been important origins and destinations for CaBi trips. Six of seven CaBi stations producing more than 500 trips were located close to Metrorail stations. This study conducted a regression analysis and found that public transit rider-ship was positively associated with CaBi ridership at the station level. A 10\% increase in annual CaBi ridership contributed to a 2.8\% increase in average daily Metrorail ridership. On the basis of these results, policy implications and recommendations are discussed.},

  abstract = {Demand for different modes of transportation clearly interacts. If public transit is delayed or out of service, customers might use mobility on demand (MoD), including taxi and carsharing for their trip, or discard the trip altogether, including a first and last mile that might otherwise be covered by MoD. For operators of taxi and carsharing services, as well as dispatching agencies, understanding increasing demand, and changing demand patterns due to outages and delays is important, as a more precise demand prediction allows for them to more profitably operate. For public authorities, it is paramount to understand this interaction when regulating transportation services. We investigate the interaction between public transit delays and demand for carsharing and taxi, as measured by the fraction of demand variance that can be explained by delays and the changing OD-patterns. A descriptive analysis of the public transit data set yields that delays and MoD demand both highly depend on the weekday and time of day, as well as the location within the city, and that delays in the city and in consecutive time intervals are correlated. Thus, demand variations must by corrected for these external influences. We find that demand for taxi and carsharing increases if the delay of public transit increases and this effect is stronger for taxi. Delays can explain at least 4.1\% (carsharing) and 18.8\% (taxi) of the demand variance, which is a good result when considering that other influencing factors, such as time of day or weather exert stronger influences. Further, planned public transit outages significantly change OD-patterns of taxi and carsharing.},

  abstract = {Multicriteria shortest path problems have not been treated intensively in the specialized literature, despite their potential applications. In fact, a single objective function may not be sufficient to characterize a practical problem completely. For instance, in a road network several parameters (as time, cost, distance, etc.) can be assigned to each arc. Clearly, the shortest path may be too expensive to be used. Nevertheless the decision-maker must be able to choose some solution, possibly not the best for all the criteria. In this paper we present two algorithms for this problem. One of them is an immediate generalization of the multiple labelling scheme algorithm of Hansen for the bicriteria case. Based on this algorithm, it is proved that any pair of nondominated paths can be connected by nondominated paths. This result is the support of an algorithm that can be viewed as a variant of the simplex method used in continuous linear multiobjective programming. A small example is presented for both algorithms.},

While cities endure lockdowns in order to ensure decent levels of health, the challenges linked to the unfolding of the pandemic have led to the need for a radical re-think of the city, leading to the re-emergence of a concept, initially proposed in 2016 by Carlos Moreno: the ``15-Minute City''. The concept, offering a novel perspective of ``chrono-urbanism'', adds to existing thematic of Smart Cities and the rhetoric of building more humane urban fabrics, outlined by Christopher Alexander, and that of building safer, more resilient, sustainable and inclusive cities, as depicted in the Sustainable Development Goal 11 of the United Nations. With the concept gaining ground in popular media and its subsequent adoption at policy level in a number of cities of varying scale and geographies, the present paper sets forth to introduce the concept, its origins, intent and future directions.},

  abstract = {A direct way of reducing the number of cars on the road is to dissuade individuals from exclusively using their car and instead integrate public transport into their daily routine. Planning multi-modal journeys is a complex task for which individuals often rely on decision support tools. However, offering individuals different journey options represents a significant algorithmic challenge. The failure to provide users with a set of journey options that differ considerably from one another in terms of the modes of transport employed is currently preventing the widespread uptake of multi-modal journey planning among the general public. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic programming algorithm that remedies this situation by modeling different transport networks as a graph that is then pruned by various graph-reduction pre-processing techniques. This approach enables us to offer a diverse set of efficient multi-modal solutions to users almost instantaneously. A computational study on three datasets corresponding to various real-world mobility networks with up to 30,000 vertices and 596,000 arcs demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Results show the scheme is used predominantly by higher-income individuals, it has a different functionality during the peak and off-peak and has been indirectly successful at improving driver awareness towards cyclists.},

This paper explores the network-wide impacts of PT strikes (train, tram, and bus strikes) on traffic congestion in Melbourne, Australia using a network modeling approach. A primary survey aimed to investigate the mode shift of users when each public transport mode ceases was conducted with 648 public transport users in May 2016. Findings show that train withdrawal was expected to result in 43\% of users shifting to car. Smaller yet significant shifts to car was also expected with bus withdrawal (34\%) and tram withdrawal (17\%). Based on the survey results and the use of a four-step transport model, train withdrawal was expected to increase the number of severely congested road links by 130\% and reduce the average travel speed from 48 km/h to 39 km/h (20\% decrease). Bus and tram withdrawal was also found to increase congestion although the result was less severe. Future research should investigate the switching behavior in actual withdrawal events and explore the long-term effects of public transport withdrawal.},

  abstract = {Disparity in spatial accessibility is strongly associated with growing inequalities among urban communities. Since improving levels of accessibility for certain communities can provide them with upward social mobility and address social exclusion and inequalities in cities, it is important to understand the nature and distribution of spatial accessibility among urban communities. To support decision-makers in achieving inclusion and fairness in policy interventions in cities, we present an open and data-driven framework to understand the spatial nature of accessibility to infrastructure among the different demographics. We find that accessibility to a wide range of infrastructure in any city (54 cities) converges to a Zipf's law, suggesting that inequalities also appear proportional to growth processes in these cities. Then, assessing spatial inequalities among the socioeconomically clustered urban profiles for 10 of those cities, we find urban communities are distinctly segregated along social and spatial lines. We find low accessibility scores for populations who have a larger share of minorities, earn less and have a relatively lower number of individuals with a university degree. These findings suggest that the reproducible framework we propose may be instrumental in understanding processes leading to spatial inequalities and in supporting cities to devise targeted measures for addressing inequalities for certain underprivileged communities.},

Statistical analyses were performed to determine what consumer characteristics explain frequency of major versus fill-in shopping and frequency of shopping in supermarkets versus convenience stores. Five different segments of consumers are distinguished on the basis of how they shop (major versus fill-in shopping) and where they shop (supermarkets versus convenience stores): Planning Suburbans, Pedestrians, Social Shoppers,City Dwellers and Flexibles. These segments differ on various characteristics. The results inform retailers of the characteristics of consumers patronizing their stores, enabling them to change the store attributes to fit consumer needs as well as the needs of new consumers.},

  abstract = {In recent years, urban planners have mentioned the importance of implementing alternative city models that encourage short trips and neighborhood-scale activities such as the 15-minute city model. Several studies show that improvements in the transportation networks encourage the citizens to move themselves into their neighborhoods' borders. People seem to respond to these actions by increasing their visits to many local places such as restaurants, bars, sports centres etc. Even though during the post-covid era, people decreased significantly their movements, it is vital to encourage the creation of friendly for walking transportation networks inside the neighborhoods of the cities, based on the concept of the 15-minute city model. Large cities are becoming bigger and bigger as they offer many job opportunities. However, the massive peoples' relocation in big cities has as a result the creation of huge transportation problems. Neighborhoods have been downgraded as they were not ready to offer several services in larger populations. The 15-minute city model is designed to ensure that each citizen has quick access (15 minutes on foot) to essential services of various types. Moreover, the implementation of the 15-minute city model demands the strengthening of transportation networks promoting sustainable solutions that can support the daily walking of the habitants. This paper focuses on a literature review of the implementation of the 15-minute city model in different big cities worldwide, starting from Paris where the model is indeed a well-suited concept and focuses to the need of a cultural change rather than urban planning. The research points out not only the fact that this model can help the neighborhoods to grow up socioeconomically but the fact that the citizens can cooperate with the local authorities and participate in the redesign of their neighborhood based on the 15-minute city model.},

This study finds evidence that the gap between theory and practice may be closing when it comes to accessibility, but that significant barriers still exist to the wider adoption of the accessibility paradigm among metropolitan planning organisations, the main entities responsible for regional transportation planning in the USA. We measure this gap by creating an accessibility index based on content analysis of a nationally representative sample of 42 US regional transportation plans (RTPs). We then use regression-tree analysis to determine the characteristics of metropolitan areas that are most likely to employ accessibility concepts. Finally, we identify barriers to a wider adoption of the accessibility paradigm. Most RTPs include accessibility-related goals, but few define the term or use accessibility-oriented performance measures. The lack of clarity on accessibility leaves vehicle speed as the fundamental criterion for success in most plans. Our analysis finds that MPOs serving large regions with high per capita income are the most likely to produce plans that focus on accessibility. We argue that such places produce more accessibility-oriented RTPs because they have greater planning capacity and recommend changes to federal planning guidelines that could speed the adoption of the accessibility paradigm in RTPs.},

In the time-expanded approach, every event at a station, e.g., the departure of a train, is modeled as a node in the graph, while in the time-dependent approach the graph contains only one node per station. Both approaches have been recently considered for (a simplified version of) the earliest arrival problem, but little is known about their relative performance. Thus far, there are only theoretical arguments in favor of the time-dependent approach. In this paper, we provide the first extensive experimental comparison of the two approaches. Using several real-world data sets, we evaluate the performance of the basic models and of several new extensions towards realistic modeling. Furthermore, new insights on solving bicriteria optimization problems in both models are presented. The time-expanded approach turns out to be more robust for modeling more complex scenarios, whereas the time-dependent approach shows a clearly better performance.},

  abstract = {One of the main challenges for cities is to provide equitable access to urban opportunities such as commerce, jobs, recreation, and other facilities and services. Several cities are planning and building mass public transport systems to overcome the accessibility gap derived from urban sprawl, spatial exclusion, and extreme land-use specialization. Nevertheless, there is no information on how these transportation projects will impact overall and relative accessibility for different population groups, especially those with current low accessibility. This study proposes a rigorous and replicable methodology to measure the impact of public transport projects on the overall accessibility and accessibility gap to urban opportunities for different socioeconomic groups. The methodology comprises three main phases: i) the characterization of accessibility to urban opportunities through public transport; ii) the measurement of the accessibility gap between socioeconomic groups, and iii) the impact of the metro's implementation on accessibility and the gap. All the procedures were implemented using open-source software and publicly available data, guaranteeing transparency and replicability. We applied this methodology to analyze the impact of implementing the First Metro Line (PLMQ) in Quito, Ecuador. The results show that the PLMQ will increase overall accessibility to urban opportunities, and this impact depends on travel time and current accessibility levels. The impact of the PLMQ on the accessibility gap will be more modest, and the benefits will be more important at long travel times. We argue that incorporating this kind of analysis on early planning phases of public transport projects will allow better planning and design decisions and inform public debate about significant investments in sustainable mobility.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that bike-sharing has the potential to encourage sustainable travel by combining the flexibility of cycling with the reliability of public transport. However, there is actually little empirical evidence concerning the scale of that effect. While many models of bike-sharing travel patterns include station locations, only a few have accounted for heterogeneity in service levels. This paper aims to fill this gap by examining the case of the bike-sharing system in the city of Pozna\'n (536,000 inhabitants). We hypothesise that a higher number of bike-sharing trips could be found in places with a higher frequency of public transport. A model based on trips data mined through a web application programming interface (over 19,240,000 GPS recorded bicycle positions), and open public transport frequency data from the general transit feed specification is used. Regression results show that while including control variables and spatial effects, the frequency of public transport was significantly associated with the number of bike-sharing trips. A positive effect existed for short and medium trips, whereas no relationship was found for long trips. Findings support the view that public transport frequency is a relevant factor for bike-sharing which should be taken into account in planning.},

  abstract = {We study a bi-modal journey planning scenario consisting of a public transit network and a transfer graph representing a secondary transportation mode (e.g., walking or cycling). Given a pair of source and target locations, the objective is to find a Pareto set of journeys optimizing arrival time and the number of required transfers. For public transit networks with a restricted, transitively closed transfer graph, one of the fastest known algorithms solving this bi-criteria problem is Trip-Based Routing [26]. However, this algorithm cannot be trivially extended to unrestricted transfer graphs. In this work, we combine Trip-Based Routing with ULTRA [5], a preprocessing technique that allows any public transit algorithm that requires transitive transfers to handle an unrestricted transfer graph. Since both ULTRA and Trip-Based Routing precompute transfer shortcuts in a preprocessing phase, a naive combination of the two leads to a three-phase algorithm that performs redundant work and produces superfluous shortcuts. We therefore propose a new, integrated preprocessing phase that combines the advantages of both and reduces the number of computed shortcuts by up to a factor of 9 compared to a naive combination. The resulting query algorithm, ULTRA-Trip-Based is the fastest known algorithm for the considered problem setting, achieving a speedup of up to 4 compared to the fastest previously known approach, ULTRA-RAPTOR.},

  abstract = {When evaluating transport projects, locational accessibility measures, which connect land use and transport systems, provide insights into the potential for wider economic benefits. Emerging evidence also suggests that accessibility measures may effectively distill complex technical analyses into representations more easily understood and discussed by stakeholders with a range of expertise. A consolidated class of accessibility measures could thus potentially be the foundation for co-creative planning in which diverse stakeholders and experts work actively with transport planners to evaluate impacts of transport alternatives, especially wider impacts beyond individual travel time savings. This paper describes the development and initial testing of CoAXs (short for Collaborative Accessibility-based Stakeholder Engagement System), an open-source stakeholder engagement tool that seeks to support co-creative transport planning. Preliminary development and focus group testing using example bus rapid transit corridors in Boston, Massachusetts, suggest that interactive mapping tools can operationalize accessibility measures as a basis for engaging stakeholders in discussing the regional value and wider impacts of transport investment.},

  abstract = {Various methods have been developed to account for travel time variability and uncertainty when analyzing public transport networks and computing related accessibility indicators. In this paper, we establish some convergence characteristics of one such method, implemented in the R5 routing engine, yielding guidelines for the minimum number of randomized schedules. This parameter has implications for result stability, analysis turnaround time, and computation costs. We also confirm that for travel time and accessibility results, there are spatially varying differences between our method and the conventional method relying on the assumption of half-headway waiting times. The conventional method appears to understate the benefits of transit in certain locations, particularly those served by multiple lines. Researchers and planning practitioners may find the R5 method preferable when analyzing complex networks or comparing transit scenarios where routes are specified in terms of headways or frequencies, rather than complete schedules with exact departure times for each trip.},

  abstract = {The value of accessibility concepts is well-established in transportation literature, but so is the low adoption of accessibility-based instruments by practitioners. Based on the premise that leveraging accessibility concepts to address public involvement challenges could promote their adoption in planning practice, this research investigates mechanisms to promote social learning among participants in public workshops. Potential mechanisms of learning include specific tool-based interactions and how such interactions reinforce structures of learning such as alignment and imagination. This paper details iterative testing of these mechanisms with a tool called CoAXs (short for Collaborative ACCESSibility-based stakeholder engagement system), through focus groups and exploratory workshops. A mixed-methods analysis of the workshops supports the expectation that alignment and imagination correlate positively with social learning, as measured by reported learning and dialog quality. Specific interactions with the accessibility-based features of CoAXs in turn correlate positively with alignment and imagination, at individual and group levels of analysis. These findings, while not robustly generalizable, suggest that effective targeted stakeholder engagement for public transport can be structured around collaborative accessibility mapping. Adoption for broader public participation requires further development, especially the incorporation of actual day-to-day experiences such as unreliable operations.},

  abstract = {In many countries strikes hit the public transport sector from time to time. Public transport strikes are important for transportation research because they can impact upon the perceived reliability of public transport services. Moreover, the traveller's most preferred alternative is removed from the choice set. The traveller is forced to make up his mind about his preferences; doing so may induce a shift from inert, habit-driven behaviour to rational behaviour. In this paper we review 13 studies of strikes in the public transport sector, discuss criteria that determine the kind and size of the effects of a public transport strike, and present the results of a survey carried out after a short, unannounced railway strike in the Netherlands. Our survey confirms the results of other studies. In the short-term mainly captive travellers are affected; these are mostly commuters without alternative modes of transport who are highly inflexible in their departure or arrival times. As a result, on average 10\textendash 20\% of the trips are cancelled. Most travellers switch to the car (either as driver or passenger) and as a result road congestion increases. Longer-term effects include a decrease in market share for public transport, which various studies estimate to be between 0.3 and 2.5\%. The effect of a strike on public transport rider-ship can be temporary or permanent, depending on the type of strike and the policy response to it.},

  abstract = {A sufficient number of studies have highlighted that walkable neighborhoods can help to reduce the risk of obesity and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The Chinese government advocates the 15-minute (15-min) walkable neighborhoods to provide citizens with 15-min walkable access to basic public services, and ultimately to improve walking behavior and overall health. Following the Walk Score metric, this paper proposes a modified method for measuring 15-min walkable neighborhoods and applies it to Shanghai, China. Based on amenity access, the assessment considers walking demands of different pedestrian groups (i.e., the entire population, children, adults, and seniors), the amenity attributes (scale and category), and the real traffic conditions. Spatial regression is further performed to determine whether significant associations exist between community socioeconomic status and 15-min walkable neighborhoods score. Results show clear variations in 15-min walkable neighborhoods score for different pedestrian groups. Regarding the overall 15-min walkable neighborhoods, highly walkable communities are primarily concentrated in the central areas; and that poorly walkable communities are dispersed in rural areas. Senior-concentrated and adult-concentrated communities are more likely to present higher walkability, while children-concentrated communities exhibit lower walkability. Moreover, communities with inferior walkability are characterized by a high proportion of floating population (nonresidents). This research provides future studies with references for evaluating 15-min walkable neighborhoods. Social inequalities in 15-min walkable neighborhoods should be emphasized, and interventions in planning implementation for building healthy communities in China should be targeted.},

  abstract = {Popular concepts in urban planning, like the 15-minute city, suggest that everyday services should be accessible to everyone within ``walking distance''. However, walking distance is usually considered from the perspective of the average person, and little effort is made to understand the temporal (daily and seasonal) variation in walking accessibility. If our aim is to create inclusive cities, we also need to address the realities of vulnerable population groups. In this study, we analysed how walking accessibility landscapes vary temporally and between population groups particularly focusing on the diverse realities of older people. We hypothesised that the temporal variation, especially seasonal, disproportionately influences their range of mobility options. To test this, we first recorded walking speeds in Finland's Helsinki Metropolitan Area during dry and winter season. We then created and compared accessibility landscapes between groups with different walking characteristics by integrating data on seasonal walking speeds, diurnal activity opening hours, and the (residential) locations of people. We showed that the diurnal variation has the largest effect on walking accessibility in the study area over seasonal and age-related variation when these variables are considered separately. Combined, these variations can explain reductions in accessibility that, in the worst-case scenario result in only 34\% of the older population having 15-minute walking access to the closest grocery shop, compared to a baseline of 93\%. However, the intra-group variation between population groups and road conditions remains large. The study highlights the importance of considering the variation in people's walking abilities, road conditions and service network when modelling walking accessibility. This is particularly important for vulnerable population groups, such as older people, who often rely on running errands on foot and may have impaired mobility. The results support spatial planners to mitigate social and spatial inequalities and help them to promote environmentally sustainable transport.},

  abstract = {As a healthy and environment-friendly trip mode, public bicycle-sharing systems, which have so far been built in hundreds of cities around the world, have been developing rapidly recently. The public bicycle-sharing systems, which are usually spatially embedded where original urban bus transport networks are located, comprise the new urban public transport system together with the bus transport networks. Therefore, studying the impact of the public bicycle-sharing systems on the original urban public transport networks is an important research subject. In this study, using the real spatial location data of the public bicycle-sharing systems of Hangzhou and Ningbo in China, we propose a multi-layer coupling spatial network model that considers the geographical information on bus stations, bus routes, and public bicycle stations by studying the urban public transport networks. The spatial network model consists of bus subnets, short-distance bicycle subnets, and short-distance walk subnets which are interdependent rather than independent. We apply the model to study the influence of bicycling between the short-distance bicycle station pairs (SDB) and walking between the short-distance bus station pairs (SDW) on the performance of the urban public transport networks. Results show that SDB and SDW can significantly reduce the average transfer times, the average path length of passengers' trips and the Gini coefficient of an urban public transport network. Therefore, the public bicycle-sharing systems can decrease the average trip time of passengers and increase the efficiency of an urban public transport network, as well as effectively improve the uneven level of traffic flow spatial distribution of an urban public transport network and will be helpful to smoothening the traffic flow and alleviating traffic congestion.},
