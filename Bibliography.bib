  abstract = {This paper proposes multiple extensions to the popular bicriterion transit routing approach -- Trip-Based Transit Routing (TBTR). Specifically, building on the premise of the HypRAPTOR algorithm, we first extend TBTR to its partitioning variant -- HypTBTR. However, the improvement in query times of HyTBTR over TBTR comes at the cost of increased preprocessing. To counter this issue, two new techniques are proposed -- a One-To-Many variant of TBTR and multilevel partitioning. Our One-To-Many algorithm can rapidly solve profile queries, which not only reduces the preprocessing time for HypTBTR, but can also aid other popular approaches such as HypRAPTOR. Next, we integrate a multilevel graph partitioning paradigm in HypTBTR and HypRAPTOR to reduce the fill-in computations. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is extensively tested on real-world large-scale datasets. Additional analysis studying the effect of hypergraph partitioning tools (hMETIS, KaHyPar, and an integer program) along with different weighting schemes is also presented.},

  abstract = {The major operational problem in one-way vehicle sharing systems is the vehicle stock imbalance problem. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a new approach for dynamically allocating vehicles to users based on ``incentivization'' schemes which use reservations to coordinate supply-anddemand mismatches and price incentives for rewarding users, if they accept to pick up their vehicle from an oversupplied station and/or to drop off it to an under-supplied station. The system incentivizes users based on the priorities of vehicle relocations from station to station, taking into account the fluctuating demand for vehicles and parking places at different stations over time. We present two different schemes for incentivizing users to act in favour of the system. Both schemes consider budget constraints and are truthful and budget-feasible. We extensively evaluated our approach through simulations and observed significant improvements in the number completed trips and system revenue.},

  abstract = {Optimizing shared vehicle systems (bike-sharing/car-sharing/ride-sharing) is more challenging compared to traditional resource allocation settings due to the presence of \textbackslash emph\{complex network externalities\} -- changes in the demand/supply at any location affect future supply throughout the system within short timescales. These externalities are well captured by steady-state Markovian models, which are therefore widely used to analyze such systems. However, using such models to design pricing/control policies is computationally difficult since the resulting optimization problems are high-dimensional and non-convex. To this end, we develop a general approximation framework for designing pricing policies in shared vehicle systems, based on a novel convex relaxation which we term \textbackslash emph\{elevated flow relaxation\}. Our approach provides the first efficient algorithms with \textbackslash emph\{rigorous approximation guarantees\} for a wide range of objective functions (throughput, revenue, welfare). For any shared vehicle system with \$n\$ stations and \$m\$ vehicles, our framework provides a pricing policy with an approximation ratio of \$1+(n-1)/m\$. This guarantee is particularly meaningful when \$m/n\$, the average number of vehicles per station is large, as is often the case in practice. Further, the simplicity of our approach allows us to extend it to more complex settings: rebalancing empty vehicles, redirecting riders to nearby vehicles, multi-objective settings (such as Ramsey pricing), incorporating travel-times, etc. Our approach yields efficient algorithms with the same approximation guarantees for all these problems, and in the process, obtains as special cases several existing heuristics and asymptotic guarantees.},

For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in milliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide different trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and query time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond, while others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on public transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a significantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and multicriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive queries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances requires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning problem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation~(buses, trains) with unrestricted modes~(walking, driving), is even harder, relying on approximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.},

  abstract = {We study a multimodal journey planning scenario consisting of a public transit network and a transfer graph which represents a secondary transportation mode (e.g., walking, cycling, e-scooter). The objective is to compute Pareto-optimal journeys with respect to arrival time and the number of used public transit trips. While various existing algorithms can efficiently compute optimal journeys in either a pure public transit network or a pure transfer graph, combining the two increases running times significantly. Existing approaches therefore typically only support limited walking between stops, either by imposing a maximum transfer distance or by requiring the transfer graph to be transitively closed. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel preprocessing technique called ULTRA (UnLimited TRAnsfers): Given an unlimited transfer graph, which may represent any non-schedule-based transportation mode, ULTRA computes a small number of transfer shortcuts that are provably sufficient for computing a Pareto set of optimal journeys. These transfer shortcuts can be integrated into a variety of state-of-the-art public transit algorithms, establishing the ULTRA-Query algorithm family. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that ULTRA improves these algorithms from limited to unlimited transfers without sacrificing query speed. This is true not just for walking, but also for faster transfer modes such as bicycle or car. Compared to the state of the art for multimodal journey planning, the fastest ULTRA-based algorithm achieves a speedup of an order of magnitude.},

Seldom included are other travel options such as carpooling, carsharing, or bikesharing, as well as the possibility to compute personalized results tailored to the specific needs and preferences of the individual user. Partially, this is due to the fact that the inclusion of various modes of transportation and user requirements quickly leads to complex, semantically enriched graph structures, which to a certain degree impede downstream procedures such as dynamic graph updates or route queries. In this paper, we aim to reduce the computational effort and specification complexity of personalized multi-modal routing by use of a preceding heuristic, which, based on information stored in a user profile, derives a set of feasible candidate travel options, which can then be evaluated by a traditional routing algorithm. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed system with two practical examples.},

  abstract = {A method for evaluating transit planning proposals using accessibility metrics is advanced in this research. A transit-accessibility model is developed intended for use by in-house transit agency planning staff as a preliminary project design and evaluation tool. It relies on readily available socioeconomic and travel data and a GIS-supported representation of the transit network. It is intended to inform planning decisions using transparent and intuitive models in a less time consuming and expensive manner than more elaborate and comprehensive planning methods. Emphasis is placed on the visualization of changes in transit level of service resulting from major facility investments. In this capacity, the accessibility metric can assist in identifying the potential ridership change and development impacts of a project. The accessibility model relies on the travel-time outputs of a transit network model, socio-economic data and information on current travel patterns. Development of a network model of transit service in the Chicago region with a focus on CTA bus and rapid transit and METRA commuter rail service is documented. The network model is intended to support on-going research, beyond the scope of this thesis, as part of the collaborative Chicago Transit Authority-MIT research effort. The impact of the proposed Circle Line rail project on employment access and commercial development potential is analyzed to illustrate the potential of the accessibility metric. The model is also applied as a sketch planning tool for intermediate stations on proposed Airport Express trains between downtown Chicago and its two major airports.},

  abstract = {Car-sharing companies have shown increasing support in the adoption of fuel-efficient cars to reduce CO2 emissions and to meet heterogeneous demand. In this paper, we consider location design and relocation problems for sharing a mixed fleet of cars and propose integer linear programs that incorporate both one-way and round-trip demand and operations. To model car movements, we use a minimum-cost flow model on a spatial\textendash temporal network given time-based demand. We maximize the total profit of renting cars minus the cost of relocation and maintenance, subject to limited budget for purchasing cars and given a CO2 emission limit. In addition, we enforce the first-come, first-served principle to eliminate denied trips. We conduct computational studies based on 2014 Zipcar data in Boston to provide insights for fleet location, car-type designs, and their environmental impacts. Our results show high utilization of cars and low demand losses and denied trips. Although the CO2 emission limit may lower car-sharing profit, high demand on new energy-efficient cars can compensate the loss and is worth being satisfied.}

To achieve this, studies are carried out focusing on three questions: ``who are using these two bicycle services?''; ``what are the factors influencing the use frequency of both bicycle systems?''; and ``which specific level of the factors influencing the use frequency of both bicycle schemes?'' To collect data from users, a survey was designed containing questions for user attributes and service experience and conducted jointly on-line and on-site at four locations with mixed land use in Hangzhou, China. Analysis results show that SBS and FBS have similar user structure but different factors influence use frequency. Based on analysis results, from the user perspective, SBS's strength is to have good quality with low cost while FBS is more flexible and free to use. Finally, recommendations for SBS are to involve more technology to expand its range to aided bikes for senior citizens and open the access for a mobile renting system, whereas for FBS, it is critical to get government cooperation and for operators to add parking area restrictions into the cellphone application, and create an on-line platform where users can find all the free-floating bike information.},

  abstract = {Power generated by the natural gas (NG) is a promising option for solving the restrictions on the development of the power industry. Consequently, the high interdependence between NG network and electricity network should be considered in this integration. In this paper, a day-ahead scheduling framework of integrated electricity and NG system (IENG) is proposed at a distribution level based on the fast alternating direction multiplier method with restart algorithm considering demand side response and uncertainties. Within the proposed framework, the detailed model of the IENG system at a distribution level is established, where the NG flow equation is processed by incremental linearization method to improve the computational efficiency. The objective is to minimize the operation costs of the entire system. With consideration of the uncertainties of distributed generation and electricity load as well as the uncertainties from the NG load, a two-stage robust optimization model is introduced to obtain the worst case within the uncertainty set, which is solved by column and constraints generation algorithm. In addition, the demand-side response (DSR) model including the decentralized air conditioning (AC) load model and the centralized ice-storage AC load model is integrated into the scheduling framework. Finally, the proposed day-ahead scheduling framework is verified by numerical studies where the optimal scheduling schemes are obtained in different cases, both the effects of the uncertainties and the performance with introducing DSR to the system operation are analyzed.},

Location-based accessibility indicators are promising candidates, but indicator values can vary strongly depending on time of day and transfer wait times. Capturing this variation increases complexity, slowing calculations. This paper presents new methods for rapid yet rigorous computation of accessibility metrics, allowing immediate feedback during early-stage transit planning while being rigorous enough for final analyses. The approach is statistical, characterizing the uncertainty and variability in accessibility metrics related to differences in departure time and headway-based scenario specification. The analysis was carried out on a detailed multimodal network model including both public transportation and streets. Land use data were represented at high resolution. These methods were implemented as open-source software running on a commodity cloud infrastructure. Networks were constructed from standard open data sources, and scenarios were built in a map-based web interface. A case study is presented, describing how these methods were applied in a long-term transportation planning process for an urbanized, polycentric Randstad region in the Netherlands.},

It is difficult to include fares in shortest-path algorithms because fares are often path-dependent. When fare policies allow discounted transfers, for example, the fare for a given journey segment depends on characteristics of previous journey segments. Existing methods to characterize tradeoffs between travel time and monetary cost objectives do not scale well to complex networks, or they rely on approximations. Additionally, they often require assumed values of time, which may be problematic for evaluating the equity of service provision. We propose a new method that allows us to find Pareto sets of paths, jointly minimizing fare and travel time. Using a case study in greater Boston, Massachusetts, USA, we test the algorithm's performance as part of an interactive web application for computing accessibility metrics. Potential extensions for journey planning and route choice models are also discussed.},

Existing algorithms consider this as a graph problem and solve it using various graph search algorithms. Unfortunately, this leads to either high query times or suboptimal solutions. We take a different approach. We introduce RAPTOR, our novel round-based public transit router. Unlike previous algorithms, it is not Dijkstra-based, looks at each route (such as a bus line) in the network at most once per round, and can be made even faster with simple pruning rules and parallelization using multiple cores. Because it does not rely on preprocessing, RAPTOR works in fully dynamic scenarios. Starting from arrival time and number of transfers as criteria, it can be easily extended to handle flexible departure times or arbitrary additional criteria. As practical examples we consider fare zones and reliability of transfers. When run on complex public transportation networks (such as London), RAPTOR computes all Pareto-optimal journeys between two random locations an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches, which easily enables interactive applications.},

Moreover, we extend it to handle the minimum expected arrival time~(MEAT) problem, which incorporates stochastic delays on the vehicles and asks for a set of~(alternative) journeys that in its entirety minimizes the user's expected arrival time at the destination.

  abstract = {This paper studies the problem of computing optimal journeys in dynamic public transit networks. We introduce a novel algorithmic framework, called Connection Scan Algorithm (CSA), to compute journeys. It organizes data as a single array of connections, which it scans once per query. Despite its simplicity, our algorithm is very versatile. We use it to solve earliest arrival and multi-criteria profile queries. Moreover, we extend it to handle the minimum expected arrival time~(MEAT) problem, which incorporates stochastic delays on the vehicles and asks for a set of~(alternative) journeys that in its entirety minimizes the user's expected arrival time at the destination. Our experiments on the dense metropolitan network of London show that CSA computes MEAT queries, our most complex scenario, in 272 ms on average.},

  abstract = {In the multimodal route planning problem, we are given multiple transportation networks (e.g., pedestrian, road, public transit) and ask for a best integrated journey between two points. The main challenge is that a seemingly optimal journey may have changes between networks that do not reflect the user's modal preferences. In fact, quickly computing reasonable multimodal routes remains a challenging problem: previous approaches either suffer from poor query performance or their available choices of modal preferences during query time is limited. In this work, we focus on computing exact multimodal journeys that can be restricted by specifying arbitrary modal sequences at query time. For example, a user can say whether he or she wants to only use public transit, prefers to also use a taxi or walking at the beginning or end of the journey, or has no restrictions at all. By carefully adapting node contraction, a common ingredient to many speedup techniques on road networks, we are able to compute point-to-point queries on a continental network combined of cars, railroads, and flights several orders of magnitude faster than Dijkstra's algorithm. Thereby, we require little space overhead and obtain fast preprocessing times.},

This problem is exposed to different sources of uncertainty, including short-term operational (e.g., rivals' offering strategies) and long-term macro (e.g., demand growth) uncertainties. This problem is formulated as a stochas-tic bilevel optimization problem, which eventually recasts as a large-scale stochastic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem with limited computational tractability. To cope with computational issues, we propose a consensus version of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which decomposes the original problem by both short-and long-term scenarios. Although the convergence of ADMM to the global solution cannot be generally guaranteed for MILP problems, we introduce two bounds on the optimal solution, allowing for the evaluation of the solution quality over iterations. Our numerical findings show that there is a trade-off between computational time and solution quality.},

  abstract = {Transportation systems are designed to help people participate in activities distributed over space and time. Accessibility indicates the collective performance of land use and transportation systems and determines how well that complex system serves its residents. This research project comprises three main tasks. The first task reviews the literature on accessibility and its performance measures with an emphasis on measures that planners and decision makers can understand and replicate. The second task identifies the appropriate measures of accessibility, where accessibility measures are evaluated in terms of ease of understanding, accuracy and complexity, while the third task illustrates these accessibility measures. During this process a new accessibility measure named 'Place Rank' is introduced as an accurate measure of accessibility. In addition, several previously-defined accessibility measures are reviewed and demonstrated in this report including cumulative opportunity and gravity-based measures. The gravity-based measure is widely used in the literature yet cumulative opportunity tends to be easier to understand and interpret by the public, planners, and administrators. A major contribution of this research is the comparison of accessibility measures over time and among various modes. Effects of accessibility on home sales are also tested. Homebuyers pay a premium to live near jobs and away from competing workers. Accessibility promises to be a useful tool for monitoring the land use and transportation system, and assessing and valuing the benefits of proposed changes to either land use or networks.},

  abstract = {We develop a robust optimization framework for dynamic empty repositioning problems modeled using time-space networks. In such problems, uncertainty arises primarily from forecasts of future supplies and demands for assets at different time epochs. The proposed approach models such uncertainty using intervals about nominal forecast values and a limit on the systemwide scaled deviation from the nominal forecast values. A robust repositioning plan is defined as one in which the typical flow balance constraints and flow bounds are satisfied for the nominal forecast values, and the plan is recoverable under a limited set of recovery actions. A plan is recoverable when feasibility can be reestablished for any outcome in a defined uncertainty set. We develop necessary and sufficient conditions for flows to be robust under this definition for three types of allowable recovery actions. When recovery actions allow only flow changes on inventory arcs, we show that the resulting problem is polynomially solvable. When recovery actions allow limited reactive repositioning flows, we develop feasibility conditions that are independent of the size of the uncertainty set. A computational study establishes the practical viability of the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Many algorithms compute shortest-path queries in mere microseconds on continental-scale networks. Most solutions are, however, tailored to either road or public transit networks in isolation. To fully exploit the transportation infrastructure, multimodal algorithms are sought to compute shortest paths combining various modes of transportation. Nonetheless, current solutions still lack performance to efficiently handle interactive queries under realistic network conditions where traffic jams, public transit cancelations, or delays often occur. We present a multimodal separators\textendash based algorithm (MUSE), a new multimodal algorithm based on graph separators to compute shortest travel time paths. It partitions the network into independent, smaller regions, enabling fast and scalable preprocessing. The partition is common to all modes and independent of traffic conditions so that the preprocessing is only executed once. MUSE relies on a state automaton that describes the sequence of modes to constrain the shortest path during the preprocessing and the online phase. The support of new sequences of mobility modes only requires the preprocessing of the cliques, independently for each partition. We also augment our algorithm with heuristics during the query phase to achieve further speedups with minimal effect on correctness. We provide experimental results on France's multimodal network containing the pedestrian, road, bicycle, and public transit networks.},

We propose a bet-and-run approach to actually turn erraticism to one's advantage. The idea is to make a number of short sample runs with randomized initial conditions, to bet on the ``most promising'' run selected according to certain simple criteria, and to bring it to completion. Computational results on a large testbed of mixed integer linear programs from the literature are presented, showing the potential of this approach even when embedded in a proof-of-concept implementation.},

This synthesis represents a critically needed evaluation of the current state of global bike share research, in order to better understand, and maximize the effectiveness of current and future programs. Several consistent themes have emerged within the growing body of research on bike share programs. Firstly, the importance bike share members place on convenience and value for money appears paramount in their motivation to sign up and use these programs. Secondly, and somewhat counter intuitively, scheme members are more likely to own and use private bicycles than nonmembers. Thirdly, users demonstrate a greater reluctance to wear helmets than private bicycle riders and helmets have acted as a deterrent in jurisdictions in which helmets are mandatory. Finally, and perhaps most importantly from a sustainable transport perspective, the majority of scheme users are substituting from sustainable modes of transport rather than the car.},

FHWA's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways includes a walking speed of 4.0 ft/s (1.2 m/s) for calculating pedestrian clearance intervals for traffic signals. It also includes a comment that where pedestrians who walk slower than normal, or pedestrians who use wheelchairs, routinely use the crosswalk, a walking speed of less than 4.0 ft/s should be considered in determining the pedestrian clearance times. A 2005 TCRP-NCHRP study found a 15th percentile walking speed for young pedestrians of 3.77 ft/s (1.15 m/s) and a 15th percentile walking speed for older pedestrians of 3.03 ft/s (0.92 m/s). The study also determined that there is a statistical difference in walking speeds between older (older than 60 years) and younger (60 years and younger) pedestrians. Using population projections and the 15th percentile walking speeds for each population group more than 15 years old, the proportionally weighted 15th percentile walking speed for 2045 is 3.56 ft/s (1.09 m/s). Comparing the findings from the TCRP-NCHRP study with previous work results in the following recommendations: 3.5-ft/s (1.07-m/s) walking speed for timing of a traffic signal; if older pedestrians are a concern, then a 3.0-ft/s (0.9-m/s) walking speed should be used.},

In such systems, users arrive at a station, take a bike and use it for a while, then return it to another station of their choice.

A stochastic model is proposed to study the effect of users random choices on the number of problematic stations, i.e., stations that host zero bikes or that have no available spots at which a bike can be returned. The influence of the stations' capacities is quantified and the fleet size that minimizes the proportion of problematic stations is computed. Even in a homogeneous city, the system exhibits a poor performance: the minimal proportion of problematic stations is to the order of (but not lower than) the inverse of the capacity. We show that simple incentives, such as suggesting users to return to the least loaded station among two stations, improve the situation by an exponential factor. We also compute the rate at which bike has to be redistributed by trucks to insure a given quality of service. This rate is to the order of the inverse of the stations capacity. For all cases considered, the optimally reliable fleet size is a little more than half of the station capacity, the value of the little more depends on the system parameters.},

  abstract = {The urban Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) includes the target to provide ``access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all'' by 2030. However, debate exists around the best indicator to measure this target, and few actual measurements exist. This is in part because basic transit data are missing from many of the world's cities, including in Africa where popular or ``informal'' systems dominate. This paper explores how to make progress in measuring indicators for the SDG transport target using Nairobi's minibus system, matatus, as a case study. We partially measure the SDG indicator for the city as currently defined by the UN and then compare the SDG measurement to a location-based accessibility indicator that incorporates income data, travel times, and land-use considerations for Nairobi's highly monocentric spatial urban form. We show that although the SDG analysis suggests generally favorable transit coverage, it also points to underlying transport inequalities for low-income residents. The more fine-grained location-based accessibility analysis reveals rapidly decreasing accessibility to opportunities as distance increases from the city's central business district. This accessibility-based analysis further highlights income-based transport inequalities, identifying opportunities for improving integrated transport for residents living on the city's near and far peripheries. Improving non-motorized transport access for those living in low-income areas with high access potential would also be important to improve access. We recommend that cities start using open-source software and open data to measure a variety of indicators needed for data-driven policy, to meet SDG 11.2 and go further to improve access to opportunities for all residents.},

A hierarchy is then generated by iteratively contracting the least important node. Contracting a node v means replacing shortest paths going through v by shortcuts. We obtain a hierarchical query algorithm using bidirectional shortest-path search. The forward search uses only edges leading to more important nodes and the backward search uses only edges coming from more important nodes. For fastest routes in road networks, the graph remains very sparse throughout the contraction process using rather simple heuristics for ordering the nodes. We have five times lower query times than the best previous hierarchical Dijkstra-based speedup techniques and a negative space overhead, i.e., the data structure for distance computation needs less space than the input graph. CHs can be combined with many other route planning techniques, leading to improved performance for many-to-many routing, transit-node routing, goal-directed routing or mobile and dynamic scenarios.},

This small search space makes it suitable to implement it on a mobile device. We present a mobile implementation that also handles changes in the road network, like traffic jams, and that allows instantaneous routing without noticeable delay for the user.

But when you want to go from a small town to another small town, even when they are next to a freeway, you run into problems. You can't find offers that would or could pass by the town easily with little or no detour. We solve this interesting problem by presenting a fast algorithm that computes the offers with the smallest detours w.r.t. a request.

How can the economic benefits associated with accessibility changes be measured? What are the accessibility benefits of having a public transport service available as a transport option for unexpected future use? How can the land-use, transport and accessibility impacts of Dutch compact urbanisation policies implemented in the last decades be measured? The research presented in this thesis seeks to answer these and related questions. Results suggest that current practices in evaluating accessibility in the Netherlands can be improved using geographical accessibility measures within an integrated land-use/transport perspective. Another major outcome is formed by the possible significant benefits associated with option use of public transport services in addition to use and non-use benefits traditionally included in transport policy appraisal. Residents in the service area of regional railway links seemed to be willing to pay significant amounts for the continued availability of the railway links for unexpected future use. Dutch compact urbanisation policies were also shown to have contributed to the land-use and transport-related intentions of the Dutch national government. Without compact urban development urban sprawl would likely have been greater, resulting in greater car use and related environmental impacts, higher congestion and lower accessibility levels, along with stronger fragmentation of wildlife habitats.},

  abstract = {A smart grid is an efficient and sustainable energy system that integrates diverse generation entities, distributed storage capacity, and smart appliances and buildings. A smart grid brings new kinds of participants in the energy market served by it, whose effect on the grid can only be determined through high fidelity simulations. Power TAC offers one such simulation platform using real-world weather data and complex state-of-the-art customer models. In Power TAC, autonomous energy brokers compete to make profits across tariff, wholesale and balancing markets while maintaining the stability of the grid. In this paper, we design an autonomous broker VidyutVanika, the runner-up in the 2018 Power TAC competition. VidyutVanika relies on reinforcement learning (RL) in the tariff market and dynamic programming in the wholesale market to solve modified versions of known Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulations in the respective markets. The novelty lies in defining the reward functions for MDPs, solving these MDPs, and the application of these solutions to real actions in the market. Unlike previous participating agents, VidyutVanika uses a neural network to predict the energy consumption of various customers using weather data. We use several heuristic ideas to bridge the gap between the restricted action spaces of the MDPs and the much more extensive action space available to VidyutVanika. These heuristics allow VidyutVanika to convert near-optimal fixed tariffs to time-of-use tariffs aimed at mitigating transmission capacity fees, spread out its orders across several auctions in the wholesale market to procure energy at a lower price, more accurately estimate parameters required for implementing the MDP solution in the wholesale market, and account for wholesale procurement costs while optimizing tariffs. We use Power TAC 2018 tournament data and controlled experiments to analyze the performance of VidyutVanika, and illustrate the efficacy of the above strategies.},

We identify and discuss eight major themes that significantly impact user trust in complex systems. We further provide guidelines for the design of trustable adaptive agents.

  abstract = {Owing to the fast deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) and the further development of demand-side management, small agents in electricity markets are becoming more proactive. This may boost the development of peer-to-peer (P2P) market mechanisms. Meanwhile, since actual load and power generation may substantially deviate from schedules obtained at the day-ahead (forward) market stage, it is needed to rapidly reschedule the trades among agents to maintain power balance through a real-time market mechanism, also in a P2P framework. However, it is technically challenging to develop and operate such P2P market mechanisms in real-time, since they most often involve a heavy computational burden (e.g., based on iterative distributed optimization approaches), while real-time trading demands fast calculation. Our core contribution is hence to describe and analyze a novel online optimization framework to enable the real-time P2P market. It relies on online social welfare maximization using a novel online consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (OC-ADMM) algorithm. The computational complexity is then heavily reduced since only one iteration is performed for each agent at every time step in order to satisfy real-time requirements. We derive a sublinear non-stationary regret upper bound for our algorithm, which implies that social welfare will be maximized in the long run. Simulations based on a number of case studies show that our algorithm has good convergence performance, tracking ability, and high computational efficiency.},

Using extensive Dutch travel diary data from the years 2010 to 2012, enriched with variables on the built and natural environment as well as on weather conditions, this study compares the predictive performance of seven selected machine learning classifiers for travel mode choice analysis and makes recommendations for model selection. In addition, it addresses the importance of different variables and how they relate to different travel modes. The results show that random forest performs significantly better than any other of the investigated classifiers, including the commonly used multinomial logit model. While trip distance is found to be the most important variable, the importance of the other variables varies with classifiers and travel modes. The importance of the meteorological variables is highest for support vector machine, while temperature is particularly important for predicting bicycle and public transport trips. The results suggest that the analysis of variable importance with respect to the different classifiers and travel modes is essential for a better understanding and effective modeling of people's travel behavior.},

In this problem, the operator, upon observing its distribution of idle vehicles, proactively allocates the idle vehicles to serve future uncertain demands. With perfect information of demand distribution, the problem can be formulated as a stochastic transportation problem. Yet, the non-stationarity and spatial correlation of demands pose significant challenges in estimating its distribution accurately from historical data. We employ a novel distributionally robust optimization approach that can utilize covariate information as well as the moment information of demand to construct a scenario-wise ambiguity set. We further illustrate how the key parameters required by the new ambiguity set, such as the scenarios and their probabilities, can be estimated via multivariate regression tree. Although information about uncertain covariates provides no value when there is perfect knowledge of demand distribution, we show that it could alleviate the over-conservativeness of the robust solution. The resulting distributionally robust optimization problem can be exactly and tractably solved using linear decision rule technique. We further validate the performance of our solution via extensive numerical simulations, and a case study using trip and vehicle status data from our partner taxi operator, paired with the rainfall data from the Meteorological Service Singapore.},

Because of the limitation on exchanging private data and the challenge in managing complex models, the proposed co-optimization model is tackled via alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) by iteratively solving a power system subproblem and a gas system subproblem. The power system subproblem is solved by column-and-constraint generation (C\&CG); outer approximation (OA), and the nonlinear gas system subproblem is solved by converting into a mixed-integer linear programming model. To overcome nonconvexity of the original problem with binary variables, a tailored ADMM with a relax-round-polish process is developed to obtain high-quality solutions. Numerical case studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for optimally coordinating electricity and natural gas systems with uncertainties.},

  abstract = {Problem definition: In this paper, we study the fleet repositioning problem for a free-float vehicle sharing system, aiming to dynamically match the vehicle supply and travel demand at the lowest total cost of repositioning and lost sales. Academic/practical relevance: Besides the analytical results on the optimal repositioning policy, the proposed optimization framework is applicable to practical problems by its computational efficiency as well as the capability to handle temporally dependent demands. Methodology: We first formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic program. To solve for a multiregion system, we deploy the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach that can incorporate demand temporal dependence, motivated by real data. We first propose a ``myopic'' two-stage DRO model that serves as both an illustration of the DRO framework and a benchmark for the later multistage model. We then develop a computationally efficient multistage DRO model with an enhanced linear decision rule (ELDR). Results: Under a two-region system, we find a simple reposition up-to and down-to policy to be optimal, when the demands are temporally independent. Such a structure is also preserved by our ELDR solution. We also provide new analytical insights by proving the optimality of ELDR in solving the single-period DRO problem. We then show that the numerical performance of the ELDR solution is close to the exact optimal solution from the dynamic program. Managerial implications: In a real-world case study of car2go, we quantify the ``value of repositioning'' and compare with several benchmarks to demonstrate that the ELDR solutions are computationally scalable and in general result in lower cost with less frequent repositioning. We also explore several managerial implications and extensions from the experiments.},

Using a case study of Toronto, we specify both origin-based and regional-scale analysis scenarios and find significant differences in computation time and calculated accessibilities. While the calculated travel time matrices are highly correlated across tools, each tool produces different results for the same origin-destination pair. Comparisons of the estimated accessibilities also reveal evidence of spatial clustering in the ways paths are calculated by some tools relative to others at different locations around the city. With the growing emphasis on accessibility-based planning, analysts should approach the calculation of accessibility with care and recognize the potential for algorithmic dependence in their calculated accessibility results.},

A long walking distance from a stop is often one of the critical factors limiting its more frequent and extensive use. Studies dealing with the accessibility of transport networks usually work only with the closest stop. This article analyses the actual walking distance from the place of residence to the preferred stop. The survey used a questionnaire method and was conducted in two cities in the Czech Republic\textemdash Ostrava and Olomouc. Based on the results of the study, the average walking distance was assessed and the impact of demographic characteristics (gender, age, education, number of members in the household, economic activity, the presence of a child in the household, and car ownership), transport behavior (preferred mode of transportation, car convenience and opinions on public transport), and urban characteristics (prevailing housing type) on the walking distance were analyzed. The main findings prove a significant impact on walking distance by a number of these factors, but the preferred use of a car for commuting or unemployment does not significantly affect walking distance.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

With a system of this scale, traditional simulation optimization methods such as stochastic gradient-search and random search are inefficient. We propose a variety of more efficient gradient-like heuristic methods that can improve any given allocation based on a discrete-event simulation model of the system. The methods are tested on data from December 2015 with different starting solutions obtained from other models. We further explore the relationship between the system behaviors during the morning and afternoon rush hours by comparing optimal solutions when the problem is restricted to these two periods.},

However, the convenience, speed and comfort achieved from using a private vehicle is seen as one of the major reasons why travellers prefer their cars. On-demand services especially when combined with the transit system have been proposed as a way forward. Yet, there are a few findings on how or where this service would be beneficial to car drivers.  In this study we model the integration of an on-demand service with public transit with the aim to find where there is potential for drivers to use transit. We also present a fleet performance measure for determining an efficient fleet size that would serve this system. Our findings show that public transit can be improved, decreasing travel time by 21\% on average, especially for drivers whose trips originate at the fringes of the city. We also show what fleet operational choices are more efficient in terms of vehicle placement and fleet sizes.},

In the past, approaches based on Dijkstra's algorithm have been proposed. For small networks, the entire network is first loaded in main memory, where the network is expanded to determine the isochrone. For large networks that do not fit in main memory, approaches that load the network vertex-by-vertex during the expansion phase have been proposed. They keep the memory footprint minimal, but have to query the database for each node in the isochrone, which can be very time consuming. The method presented in this paper uses tiles (which are well known from interactive online maps) to realize chunk-loading of vertices by utilizing so-called tile regions. This approach significantly reduces the number of database requests, while keeping the memory usage low. Our method is able to compute isochrones even in large networks at a reasonable time. An experimental evaluation shows that the new algorithm clearly outperforms previous competitive approaches such as MINE and MINEX.},

New algorithmic techniques are developed which derive cost-effective relocation tours by primarily minimizing relocation drivers' walking time. Car repositioning takes place overnight and aims at complete rebalancing of the system i.e., at achieving an optimal, based on user demand, cars distribution among non-overlapping cells of the FFCS's operating area. The battery level of the electric cars is also taken into account when deciding if and where each car will be relocated. If {$<$}inline-formula{$>$} {$<$}tex-math notation="LaTeX"{$>\$$}k\$ {$<$}/tex-math{$><$}/inline-formula{$>$} is the number of employees handling car relocations from oversupplied to undersupplied regions, when {$<$}inline-formula{$>$} {$<$}tex-math notation="LaTeX"{$>\$$}k=1\$ {$<$}/tex-math{$><$}/inline-formula{$>$} i.e., there exists a single employee carrying out a relocation tour comprising alternating phases of a car relocation followed by walking to the next to be relocated car, we define and solve the Minimum Walking Car Repositioning Problem (MWCRP) whose main objective is to minimize the walking distance in the relocation tour as the walking part of such a tour is tiresome and takes more time than the driving one.

It is worth mentioning that these are the first vehicle relocation techniques lowering the relocation cost by mostly minimizing the walking cost. Performance results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.}

  abstract = {Striving to reflect on the significance and comprehensiveness of access applications, we collected 19 chapters covering access research in seven main categories to illustrate the state-of-the-art of access applications along distinct dimensions of transport studies.     Our chapters cover access research at the international, national, metropolitan, and city levels. American cities are studied in chapter 3, chapter 4, chapter 11, chapter 14, chapter 16, chapter 18, and chapter 19. International cases are assessed and compared in chapter 2 and chapter 17, while chapter 9 examines Munich, Germany and chapter 13 analyzes Jakarta, Indonesia.     Chapters are grouped into seven informal and overlapping categories:     Equity and social justice:     In chapter 2, Santos and Boisjoly discuss a series of case studies that display a growing concern for transport equity. They suggest that professionals and policymakers can adopt access-based approaches to foster social inclusion through equitable transport policies. In chapter 3, Palmateer and Levinson evaluate potential measures of distributive justice based on the access to jobs provided by various modes and offer recommendations for appropriate use of each measure. In chapter 4, Borowski, Ermagun, and Levinson explore the relation between transit-based job access and minority races and ethnicities, low- and middle-income households, and carless households at the block group level for the 50 most populated metropolitan areas in the United States. The analyses show that access is unevenly distributed across metropolitan regions across the US when considering various socio-demographic populations. Different metropolitan regions provide different levels of access for all investigated socio-demographic categories, whether considering racial minorities, levels of income, or car ownership.     Resilience and crisis:     In chapter 5, DeWeese, Manaugh, and El-Geneidy show how access can be used as a rapid diagnostic tool to assess the potential impacts of public transport service adjustments during a public health crisis. In chapter 6, Ghorbanzadeh, Kim, Ozguven, and Horner assess the spatial access of US census population block groups to congregate and non-congregate shelters in Northwest Florida. They argue that many areas in Northwest Florida have lower access to non-congregate shelters compared to congregate shelters.     Active transport:     In chapter 7, Murphy, Owen, and Levinson predict pedestrian activity using scalable and transferable predictive variables. They show that access to jobs by walking and transit, automobile traffic, and specific economic job categories (Education, Finance) are significant predictors of increased pedestrian traffic. In contrast, access to other economic job categories (Management, Utilities) significantly predict decreased pedestrian traffic. In chapter 8, Schoner and Levinson study people's navigation from place to place using the Nice Ride Minnesota bikeshare system in Minneapolis. The results indicate people prefer to use stations that do not require long detours out of the way to access. However, commuters and non-work travelers differ in how they value the walking portion of their trip and what station amenities and neighborhood features increase a station's utility. In chapter 9, Duran-Rodas, Nichols, and B\"uttner conducted a spatial fairness assessment to analyze which social groups are favored with active access to Urban E-commerce Infrastructure (UEI) in Munich and claim that e-commerce infrastructure benefits the cosmopolitan population, regardless of social status.     Public transport:     In chapter 10, Zeng, Song, and Chen present methods and procedures to evaluate grocery store spatio-temporal access considering coupled constraints of transit schedules and store opening hours. The findings suggest that decision-makers need to consider the variations in access levels across different spatial locations, times of the day, and social groups within various living-built environments. In chapter 11, Guthrie and Fan explore the ability of transit systems in regions to provide post-secondary education and job placement services destinations for marginalized workers. Their results provide compelling evidence for the social equity benefits of regional transit investments and the importance of integrated transit, land use, and regional public service planning.     Auto travel:     In chapter 12, Huang and Levinson examine the impact of land use around the home on vehicle trip generation and identify the correlation of trips made by the same individual in the trip generation models. The results indicate that although access around the home is not found to have statistically significant effects on non-work vehicle trips, the diversity of services within 10 to 15 minutes and 15 to 20 minutes from home can help reduce the number of non-work vehicle trips. In chapter 13, Andani, Paix, Rachmat, Syabri, and Geurs describe an evaluation of the job access and spatial equity impacts of the Cipularang toll road in the Jakarta \textendash{} Bandung corridor in Indonesia. The analysis reveals that the construction of the toll road has reduced travel time in the whole region by 13\%, and potential job access increased by 5\%.     System performance:     In chapter 14, Ermagun and Levinson disentangle the impacts of financial and physical dimensions of transit service operators on net transit access. The results indicate that using the same operating expenses for both bus and train services, the bus system provides roughly 6 times more access than the train system. The bus system also operates 4 times more efficiently than the train system, providing access with the same frequency. In chapter 15, Iacono, Cao, Cui, and Levinson investigate the relation between urban access and firm agglomeration, as reflected in patterns of employment densities. They argue that urbanization effects tend to overshadow those of localization effects. These effects vary by sector, with many service-based sectors showing a stronger propensity to agglomerate than manufacturing and several ``basic'' sectors like agriculture, mining, and utilities. In chapter 16, Janatabadi, Tajik, and Ermagun study the spatial and temporal disparity of modal access to employment in Chicago and its nine neighborhoods. The findings alert urban planners and policymakers on the effects of travel time and space on access analysis. They also explain how inaccurate perceptions of transit performance prevent the development of an effective and equitable transit system.     Project evaluation:     In chapter 17, Stewart and Byrd evaluate how interactive tools for calculating and visualizing indicators of access to opportunities can facilitate more integrated metropolitan planning. In chapter 18, Palmateer, Ermagun, Owen, and Levinson examine the importance of service area definition when utilizing access-based evaluation in transit projects. The results indicate that the choice of transit service areas significantly impacts the value of absolute access measures. In chapter 19, Palmateer, Owen, and Ermagun use the access-based evaluation method to unpack the interaction effect of transit-oriented development and a new transit hub using the San Francisco Transbay Transit Center Development Plan project. This indicates that in areas where there already is transit service, the development of land near the transit service can have a greater impact on access levels than the improvement of connections between transit services. The book ends in chapter 20 with a review by Jin, Cheng, and Witlox of how virtual access interacts with physical access and how the interaction affects travel-access relations in the future.},

  abstract = {Bike-sharing systems are widely deployed in many major cities, while the jammed and empty stations in them lead to severe customer loss. Currently, operators try to constantly reposition bikes among stations when the system is operating. However, how to efficiently reposition to minimize the customer loss in a long period remains unsolved. We propose a spatio-temporal reinforcement learning based bike reposition model to deal with this problem. Firstly, an inter-independent inner-balance clustering algorithm is proposed to cluster stations into groups. Clusters obtained have two properties, i.e. each cluster is inner-balanced and independent from the others. As there are many trikes repositioning in a very large system simultaneously, clustering is necessary to reduce the problem complexity. Secondly, we allocate multiple trikes to each cluster to conduct inner-cluster bike reposition. A spatio-temporal reinforcement learning model is designed for each cluster to learn a reposition policy in it, targeting at minimizing its customer loss in a long period. To learn each model, we design a deep neural network to estimate its optimal long-term value function, from which the optimal policy can be easily inferred. Besides formulating the model in a multi-agent way, we further reduce its training complexity by two spatio-temporal pruning rules. Thirdly, we design a system simulator based on two predictors to train and evaluate the reposition model. Experiments on real-world datasets from Citi Bike are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of our model.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a bike repositioning problem with multiple depots, multiple visits, and multiple heterogeneous vehicles for the free-floating bike-sharing system (FFBSS) is studied. Two types of nodes (i.e., easily and hardly access nodes) with different penalties are defined to represent different convenience levels of getting bikes from the FFBSS. The objective of the repositioning is to minimize the weighted sum of the inconvenience level of getting bikes from the system and the total unmet demand and the total operational time. To solve this problem, an enhanced version of chemical reaction optimization (CRO) is developed. A loading and unloading quantity adjustment procedure with the consideration of the node characteristics, including the type of node and its current state (i.e., in a balanced, surplus, or deficit state) is proposed and incorporated into this version to improve its solution quality. A concept of the nearby-node set is also proposed to narrow the search space. Numerical results are presented and indicate that compared to the traditional CRO and CPLEX, the enhanced CRO improves solution quality and has potential to tackle the repositioning problem for larger, longer repositioning duration, and more vehicle instances. The results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adjustment procedure.},

The scheduling problem is first formulated as a stochastic sequential decision program. To solve the strategy for an EVCS system with multiple city regions, we deploy the distributional event-based dynamic optimization approach that can coordinate the serving, charging and relocating decisions of shared electrical vehicles (SEV). To maximize the daily income of system, a gradient-based strategy iterative algorithm is applied to solve the scheduling problem. Finally, a computational experiment is performed, and the results show that the proposed optimization framework is applicable to the EVCS system scheduling problem by its efficiency as well as the capability to handle the fluctuating user requests and electrical load.},

  abstract = {Bicycle-sharing programs have emerged around the world. Theoretically, the effect of bicycle sharing on more conventional transit modes can take a substitute or complementary form. On one hand, bicycle sharing could substitute for conventional transit as a convenient and sustainable travel option. On the other hand, bicycle sharing may complement such transit by seamlessly connecting transit stations with origins and destinations and thus increase accessibility. However, the questions of how and to what extent bicycle-sharing programs affect public transit ridership remain to be answered, despite the attempts of a few empirical and quantitative studies. This study examined the impact of the Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) program on Metrorail's ridership in Washington, D.C. When CaBi trips were mapped, it was observed that Metrorail stations had been important origins and destinations for CaBi trips. Six of seven CaBi stations producing more than 500 trips were located close to Metrorail stations. This study conducted a regression analysis and found that public transit rider-ship was positively associated with CaBi ridership at the station level. A 10\% increase in annual CaBi ridership contributed to a 2.8\% increase in average daily Metrorail ridership. On the basis of these results, policy implications and recommendations are discussed.},

Therefore, designing efficient algorithms of practical relevance is crucial, though their global optimality is not guaranteed. Existing semidefinite programming relaxation-based approaches are restricted to OPF problems where zero duality holds. In this paper, an efficient novel method to address the general nonconvex OPF problem is investigated. The proposed method is based on an alternating direction method of multipliers combined with sequential convex approximations. The global OPF problem is decomposed into smaller problems associated with each bus of the network, the solutions of which are coordinated via a light communication protocol. Therefore, the proposed method is highly scalable. The convergence properties of the proposed algorithm are mathematically substantiated. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a number of test examples, where the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm are numerically substantiated, and the performance is compared with a global optimal method.},

  abstract = {Demand for different modes of transportation clearly interacts. If public transit is delayed or out of service, customers might use mobility on demand (MoD), including taxi and carsharing for their trip, or discard the trip altogether, including a first and last mile that might otherwise be covered by MoD. For operators of taxi and carsharing services, as well as dispatching agencies, understanding increasing demand, and changing demand patterns due to outages and delays is important, as a more precise demand prediction allows for them to more profitably operate. For public authorities, it is paramount to understand this interaction when regulating transportation services. We investigate the interaction between public transit delays and demand for carsharing and taxi, as measured by the fraction of demand variance that can be explained by delays and the changing OD-patterns. A descriptive analysis of the public transit data set yields that delays and MoD demand both highly depend on the weekday and time of day, as well as the location within the city, and that delays in the city and in consecutive time intervals are correlated. Thus, demand variations must by corrected for these external influences. We find that demand for taxi and carsharing increases if the delay of public transit increases and this effect is stronger for taxi. Delays can explain at least 4.1\% (carsharing) and 18.8\% (taxi) of the demand variance, which is a good result when considering that other influencing factors, such as time of day or weather exert stronger influences. Further, planned public transit outages significantly change OD-patterns of taxi and carsharing.},

  abstract = {Multicriteria shortest path problems have not been treated intensively in the specialized literature, despite their potential applications. In fact, a single objective function may not be sufficient to characterize a practical problem completely. For instance, in a road network several parameters (as time, cost, distance, etc.) can be assigned to each arc. Clearly, the shortest path may be too expensive to be used. Nevertheless the decision-maker must be able to choose some solution, possibly not the best for all the criteria. In this paper we present two algorithms for this problem. One of them is an immediate generalization of the multiple labelling scheme algorithm of Hansen for the bicriteria case. Based on this algorithm, it is proved that any pair of nondominated paths can be connected by nondominated paths. This result is the support of an algorithm that can be viewed as a variant of the simplex method used in continuous linear multiobjective programming. A small example is presented for both algorithms.},

  abstract = {A direct way of reducing the number of cars on the road is to dissuade individuals from exclusively using their car and instead integrate public transport into their daily routine. Planning multi-modal journeys is a complex task for which individuals often rely on decision support tools. However, offering individuals different journey options represents a significant algorithmic challenge. The failure to provide users with a set of journey options that differ considerably from one another in terms of the modes of transport employed is currently preventing the widespread uptake of multi-modal journey planning among the general public. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic programming algorithm that remedies this situation by modeling different transport networks as a graph that is then pruned by various graph-reduction pre-processing techniques. This approach enables us to offer a diverse set of efficient multi-modal solutions to users almost instantaneously. A computational study on three datasets corresponding to various real-world mobility networks with up to 30,000 vertices and 596,000 arcs demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

In a separable optimization problem there is a private cost function and a private constraint set at each node. The goal is to minimize the sum of all the cost functions, constraining the solution to be in the intersection of all the constraint sets. D-ADMM is proven to converge when the network is bipartite or when all the functions are strongly convex, although in practice, convergence is observed even when these conditions are not met. We use D-ADMM to solve the following problems from signal processing and control: average consensus, compressed sensing, and support vector machines. Our simulations show that D-ADMM requires less communications than state-of-the-art algorithms to achieve a given accuracy level. Algorithms with low communication requirements are important, for example, in sensor networks, where sensors are typically battery-operated and communicating is the most energy consuming operation.},

The increasing share of distributed energy resources and electrification in different sectors bring several challenges to retailers. Among these challenges, procuring electricity and maintaining system reliability during peak times induce high costs to retailers. Therefore, they need to accurately predict customers' demand to participate in the wholesale market and develop proper tariff mechanisms considering other retailers' behavior to maximize their profit. This paper develops the design of an autonomous retailer in which a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) algorithm is employed to predict customers' net demand. Furthermore, using Reinforcement Learning (RL), the proposed retailer designs tariff mechanisms based on other retailers' behavior and customers' load profiles. The proposed design of the retailer is evaluated on a retail market simulation platform called Power TAC, in which autonomous retailers compete in retail, wholesale, and balancing markets to maximize their profits. The results show the accuracy of the proposed load prediction method compared with other methods and successful profit growth with a drop in fixed costs and balancing costs.},

This paper explores the network-wide impacts of PT strikes (train, tram, and bus strikes) on traffic congestion in Melbourne, Australia using a network modeling approach. A primary survey aimed to investigate the mode shift of users when each public transport mode ceases was conducted with 648 public transport users in May 2016. Findings show that train withdrawal was expected to result in 43\% of users shifting to car. Smaller yet significant shifts to car was also expected with bus withdrawal (34\%) and tram withdrawal (17\%). Based on the survey results and the use of a four-step transport model, train withdrawal was expected to increase the number of severely congested road links by 130\% and reduce the average travel speed from 48 km/h to 39 km/h (20\% decrease). Bus and tram withdrawal was also found to increase congestion although the result was less severe. Future research should investigate the switching behavior in actual withdrawal events and explore the long-term effects of public transport withdrawal.},

In our proposed optimization model, a time-varying load constraint is introduced to better capture the consumption variation of customers and hence gives our approach an adaptive feature as well as facilitates DR. Then our approach enables all generation and demand units to actively collaborate in a distributed manner to obtain the optimal electric price and their optimal power updates in real-time while achieving their best profits. To do so, the total welfare in the grid is maximized and the optimization problem is analytically solved using the alternating direction method of multipliers and consensus theory for multi-agent systems. Moreover, the power balance constraint is guaranteed in every iteration of the proposed algorithm. Next, the effects of renewable energy to conventional generation, consumer consumption, and electric price are theoretically revealed which show the essential role of renewable energy for peak load shifting. Finally, simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system are introduced to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Buyers need DR to improve the reliability of their own electricity dependent businesses and systems. Sellers have the capacity to significantly modify electricity demand on request. Microeconomic theory is applied to model the DRX in the form of a pool-based market. In this market, a DRX Operator (DRXO) collects DR bids and offers from the buyers and sellers respectively. It then clears the market by maximizing the total market benefit subject to certain constraints including: demand-supply balance, and assurance contracts related to individual buyer contributions for DR. The DRX model is also tested on a small power system, and its efficiency is reported.},

Post tournament analysis shows that AgentUDE17 successfully optimized its tariff parameters on the fly and significantly increased its utility. Additionally, it managed to reduce its peak-demand charges thanks to its adaptive TOU price schemes.},

  abstract = {Car-sharing systems have attracted plenty of attention for the past few decades as a means to fulfill constantly growing mobility needs especially in urban areas, and to alleviate the difficulties caused by economical and environmental problems due to excessive (and increasing) private car ownership. One of the main challenges faced in car-sharing systems is to maintain a good balance between vehicle supply and user demands by means of relocating the vehicles from regions with excess supply to regions with excess demand. We examine two vehicle relocation problems in a free-floating car-sharing system, which allows users to pick up/drop off vehicles from/to any location of their choice, and pay as they go. Vehicle relocations are typically performed by dedicated personnel, also known as operators, in car-sharing systems. First, we propose an operator-based vehicle relocation model which provides a relocation plan for the vehicles along with a set of routes for the operators consistent with the planned relocation tasks. Second, we formulate a hybrid relocation problem where, in addition to operators, users are also encouraged to participate in repositioning of the vehicles in return for a discount. Both problems are formulated as mixed-integer programs on appropriately defined time-space networks. Furthermore, new sets of instances are generated, and the proposed models are used to obtain solutions to these problem instances. A computational study is conducted to evaluate the operational efficiency of the car-sharing system based on key performance indicators, namely, objective value, number of rejected users and vehicle/operator utilization levels.},

  abstract = {Free-floating bike sharing (FFBS) is an innovative bike sharing model. FFBS saves on start-up cost, in comparison to station-based bike sharing (SBBS), by avoiding construction of expensive docking stations and kiosk machines. FFBS prevents bike theft and offers significant opportunities for smart management by tracking bikes in real-time with built-in GPS. However, like SBBS, the success of FFBS depends on the efficiency of its rebalancing operations to serve the maximal demand as possible. Bicycle rebalancing refers to the reestablishment of the number of bikes at sites to desired quantities by using a fleet of vehicles transporting the bicycles. Static rebalancing for SBBS is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. FFBS takes it a step further, with an increase in the scale of the problem. This article is the first effort in a series of studies of FFBS planning and management, tackling static rebalancing with single and multiple vehicles. We present a Novel Mixed Integer Linear Program for solving the Static Complete Rebalancing Problem. The proposed formulation, can not only handle single as well as multiple vehicles, but also allows for multiple visits to a node by the same vehicle. We present a hybrid nested large neighborhood search with variable neighborhood descent algorithm, which is both effective and efficient in solving static complete rebalancing problems for large-scale bike sharing programs. Computational experiments were carried out on the 1 Commodity Pickup and Delivery Traveling Salesman Problem (1-PDTSP) instances used previously in the literature and on three new sets of instances, two (one real-life and one general) based on Share-A-Bull Bikes (SABB) FFBS program recently launched at the Tampa campus of University of South Florida and the other based on Divvy SBBS in Chicago. Computational experiments on the 1-PDTSP instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms a tabu search algorithm and is highly competitive with exact algorithms previously reported in the literature for solving static rebalancing problems in SBSS. Computational experiments on the SABB and Divvy instances, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to deal with the increase in scale of the static rebalancing problem pertaining to both FFBS and SBBS, while deriving high-quality solutions in a reasonable amount of CPU time.},

This study finds evidence that the gap between theory and practice may be closing when it comes to accessibility, but that significant barriers still exist to the wider adoption of the accessibility paradigm among metropolitan planning organisations, the main entities responsible for regional transportation planning in the USA. We measure this gap by creating an accessibility index based on content analysis of a nationally representative sample of 42 US regional transportation plans (RTPs). We then use regression-tree analysis to determine the characteristics of metropolitan areas that are most likely to employ accessibility concepts. Finally, we identify barriers to a wider adoption of the accessibility paradigm. Most RTPs include accessibility-related goals, but few define the term or use accessibility-oriented performance measures. The lack of clarity on accessibility leaves vehicle speed as the fundamental criterion for success in most plans. Our analysis finds that MPOs serving large regions with high per capita income are the most likely to produce plans that focus on accessibility. We argue that such places produce more accessibility-oriented RTPs because they have greater planning capacity and recommend changes to federal planning guidelines that could speed the adoption of the accessibility paradigm in RTPs.},

In the time-expanded approach, every event at a station, e.g., the departure of a train, is modeled as a node in the graph, while in the time-dependent approach the graph contains only one node per station. Both approaches have been recently considered for (a simplified version of) the earliest arrival problem, but little is known about their relative performance. Thus far, there are only theoretical arguments in favor of the time-dependent approach. In this paper, we provide the first extensive experimental comparison of the two approaches. Using several real-world data sets, we evaluate the performance of the basic models and of several new extensions towards realistic modeling. Furthermore, new insights on solving bicriteria optimization problems in both models are presented. The time-expanded approach turns out to be more robust for modeling more complex scenarios, whereas the time-dependent approach shows a clearly better performance.},

  abstract = {One of the main challenges for cities is to provide equitable access to urban opportunities such as commerce, jobs, recreation, and other facilities and services. Several cities are planning and building mass public transport systems to overcome the accessibility gap derived from urban sprawl, spatial exclusion, and extreme land-use specialization. Nevertheless, there is no information on how these transportation projects will impact overall and relative accessibility for different population groups, especially those with current low accessibility. This study proposes a rigorous and replicable methodology to measure the impact of public transport projects on the overall accessibility and accessibility gap to urban opportunities for different socioeconomic groups. The methodology comprises three main phases: i) the characterization of accessibility to urban opportunities through public transport; ii) the measurement of the accessibility gap between socioeconomic groups, and iii) the impact of the metro's implementation on accessibility and the gap. All the procedures were implemented using open-source software and publicly available data, guaranteeing transparency and replicability. We applied this methodology to analyze the impact of implementing the First Metro Line (PLMQ) in Quito, Ecuador. The results show that the PLMQ will increase overall accessibility to urban opportunities, and this impact depends on travel time and current accessibility levels. The impact of the PLMQ on the accessibility gap will be more modest, and the benefits will be more important at long travel times. We argue that incorporating this kind of analysis on early planning phases of public transport projects will allow better planning and design decisions and inform public debate about significant investments in sustainable mobility.},

  abstract = {Public Bike Sharing Systems provide a progressive option for urban mobility, not only for commuters but also for spontaneous users and tourists. Such systems are only reasonable, if the bikes are available where the users need them at a certain time though. In so-called free-floating systems as it's implemented in Munich, the user is allowed to rent and return a bike within a clearly defined operating area. However, on one hand there are zones, where a shortage of returned bikes occurs. No bikes are available but needed there. On the other hand there are zones, where too many bikes were returned but the demand for renting a bike there is too low. Based on a detailed GPS-Data Analysis for the bike sharing system, mobility patterns of the usage were identified. Depending on different factors like weather conditions, time of the day and holidays/weekends, a demand model was created in order to obtain an optimal distribution of bikes within the operating area. At the end of this paper an application of an operater-based relocation strategy is given. By relocating at least some part of the fleet, it's ensured that the demand for bikes is optimally satisfied in time and space.},

  abstract = {The Genetic Algorithms (GAs) paradigm is being used increasingly in search and optimization problems. The method has shown to be efficient and robust in a considerable number of scientific domains, where the complexity and cardinality of the problems considered elected themselves as key factors to be taken into account. However, there are still some insufficiencies; indeed, one of the major problems usually associated with the use of GAs is the premature convergence to solutions coding local optima of the objective function. The problem is tightly related with the loss of genetic diversity of the GA's population, being the cause of a decrease on the quality of the solutions found. Out of question, this fact has lead to the development of different techniques aiming to solve, or at least to minimize the problem; traditional methods usually work to maintain a certain degree of genetic diversity on the target populations, without affecting the convergence process of the GA. In one's work, some of these techniques are compared and an innovative one, the Random Offspring Generation, is presented and evaluated in its merits. The Traveling Salesman Problem is used as a benchmark.},

We introduce an approach for addressing the fundamental problem of semantic heterogeneity in the design of data integration requirements during DW development. In contrast to ontology-driven or schema-matching approaches, which propose the automatic resolution of differences ex-post, our approach addresses the core problem of data integration requirements: understanding and resolving different contextual meanings of data fields. We ground the approach firmly in communication theory and build on practices from agile software development. Besides providing relevant insights for the design of data integration requirements, our findings point to communication theory as a sound underlying foundation for a design theory of information systems development.},

  abstract = {We study a bi-modal journey planning scenario consisting of a public transit network and a transfer graph representing a secondary transportation mode (e.g., walking or cycling). Given a pair of source and target locations, the objective is to find a Pareto set of journeys optimizing arrival time and the number of required transfers. For public transit networks with a restricted, transitively closed transfer graph, one of the fastest known algorithms solving this bi-criteria problem is Trip-Based Routing [26]. However, this algorithm cannot be trivially extended to unrestricted transfer graphs. In this work, we combine Trip-Based Routing with ULTRA [5], a preprocessing technique that allows any public transit algorithm that requires transitive transfers to handle an unrestricted transfer graph. Since both ULTRA and Trip-Based Routing precompute transfer shortcuts in a preprocessing phase, a naive combination of the two leads to a three-phase algorithm that performs redundant work and produces superfluous shortcuts. We therefore propose a new, integrated preprocessing phase that combines the advantages of both and reduces the number of computed shortcuts by up to a factor of 9 compared to a naive combination. The resulting query algorithm, ULTRA-Trip-Based is the fastest known algorithm for the considered problem setting, achieving a speedup of up to 4 compared to the fastest previously known approach, ULTRA-RAPTOR.},

This paper reports findings from longitudinal analyses of the German nation-wide travel survey KONTIV for the period 1976\textendash 2002. It focuses on travel mode choice, subdivided by distance categories, and also takes car availability and city size into account. In addition, trends in car availability itself are examined by city size categories. The results indicate that even within the same distance categories car use has considerably increased. In some cases bicycle use has increased as well. Gains in the use of the private car are mainly at the expense of trips on foot and by public transport. Accordingly, the shift in modal split towards the car is not (only) caused by increasing trip distances but took place even within distance classes. Once car availability is taken into account, the modal shifts appear to be considerably weaker. This suggests that once car availability is held constant the decision rationales of mode choice for a certain trip distance have remained relatively stable. The increase in motorisation over the study period was considerably weaker in large cities than in small towns, although the cities started from a lower level in the 1970s. Thus, the motorisation divide between cities on the one hand, and suburban and rural areas on the other hand has become ever wider. For travel mode choice, the picture is similar. What is more, the results suggest that even car owners are more inclined to walk a given distance in the cities than in small towns, even more so if they live in a central urban area. The built environment, thus, appears to have a strong impact on whether an available car is used or not.},

  abstract = {Carsharing has become an important addition to existing mobility services over the last years. Today, several different systems are operating in many big cities. For an efficient and economic operation of any carsharing system, the identification of customer demand is essential. This demand is investigated within the presented research by analyzing booking data of a German free-floating carsharing system. The objectives of this paper are to describe carsharing usage and to identify factors that have an influence on the demand for carsharing. Therefore, the booking data are analyzed for temporal aspects, showing recurring patterns of varying lengths. The spatial distribution of bookings is investigated using a geographic information system and indicates a relationship between city structure and areas with high demand for carsharing. The temporal and spatial facets are then combined by applying a cluster analysis to identify groups of days with similar spatial booking patterns and show asymmetries in the spatiotemporal distribution of vehicle supply and demand. Influences on demand can be either short-term or long-term. The paper shows that changes in the weather conditions are a short-term influence as users of free-floating carsharing react to those. Furthermore, the application of a linear regression analysis reveals that socio-demographic data are suitable for making long-term demand predictions since booking numbers show quite a strong correlation with socio-demography, even in a simple model.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings A growing number of planning researchers and practitioners argue for a shift from mobility-centered transportation planning to an accessibility-focused one. Accessibility is a compelling concept that has proven more difficult to operationalize than mobility, which helps to explain why so many accessibility metrics have been developed for urban research and planning practice. To assess the state of these metrics, we reviewed 54 of them in light of their theoretical basis, data requirements, units of analysis, travel modes and trip purposes accounted for, and potential applications to planning practice. We also reviewed the substantial literature on accessibility measurement and interviewed planning practitioners who are applying accessibility metrics in practice. We find that accessibility theory and measurement has advanced more rapidly than applications in practice. However, a new generation of tools is emerging that may accelerate the move to accessibility planning. Although many of the measures focus on a single travel mode, the number of multimodal metrics is growing. Most of the measures are designed for regional-scale planning and scenario evaluation; only a few to date are intended for project evaluation.Takeaway for practice The 54 accessibility metrics and tools we reviewed vary widely and none stands out as obviously superior for planning practice. Although most calculate the accessibility of places, and many do so reasonably well, we see the most promise in measures of the accessibility of travelers, which can then be aggregated for place-based analyses while still shedding light on how access can vary substantially across different types of travelers. The principal challenge to broadly deploying accessibility analyses in practice in the years ahead is in developing measures that meaningfully measure the many salient dimensions of access, have manageable data requirements, and are understandable to planners, public officials, and community members.},

Emerging evidence also suggests that accessibility measures may effectively distill complex technical analyses into representations more easily understood and discussed by stakeholders with a range of expertise. A consolidated class of accessibility measures could thus potentially be the foundation for co-creative planning in which diverse stakeholders and experts work actively with transport planners to evaluate impacts of transport alternatives, especially wider impacts beyond individual travel time savings. This paper describes the development and initial testing of CoAXs (short for Collaborative Accessibility-based Stakeholder Engagement System), an open-source stakeholder engagement tool that seeks to support co-creative transport planning. Preliminary development and focus group testing using example bus rapid transit corridors in Boston, Massachusetts, suggest that interactive mapping tools can operationalize accessibility measures as a basis for engaging stakeholders in discussing the regional value and wider impacts of transport investment.},

This parameter has implications for result stability, analysis turnaround time, and computation costs. We also confirm that for travel time and accessibility results, there are spatially varying differences between our method and the conventional method relying on the assumption of half-headway waiting times. The conventional method appears to understate the benefits of transit in certain locations, particularly those served by multiple lines. Researchers and planning practitioners may find the R5 method preferable when analyzing complex networks or comparing transit scenarios where routes are specified in terms of headways or frequencies, rather than complete schedules with exact departure times for each trip.},

  abstract = {The value of accessibility concepts is well-established in transportation literature, but so is the low adoption of accessibility-based instruments by practitioners. Based on the premise that leveraging accessibility concepts to address public involvement challenges could promote their adoption in planning practice, this research investigates mechanisms to promote social learning among participants in public workshops. Potential mechanisms of learning include specific tool-based interactions and how such interactions reinforce structures of learning such as alignment and imagination. This paper details iterative testing of these mechanisms with a tool called CoAXs (short for Collaborative ACCESSibility-based stakeholder engagement system), through focus groups and exploratory workshops. A mixed-methods analysis of the workshops supports the expectation that alignment and imagination correlate positively with social learning, as measured by reported learning and dialog quality. Specific interactions with the accessibility-based features of CoAXs in turn correlate positively with alignment and imagination, at individual and group levels of analysis. These findings, while not robustly generalizable, suggest that effective targeted stakeholder engagement for public transport can be structured around collaborative accessibility mapping. Adoption for broader public participation requires further development, especially the incorporation of actual day-to-day experiences such as unreliable operations.},

This problem is subject to uncertainties along multiple dimensions \textemdash{} including demand, travel time, and repositioning duration \textemdash{} and faces several operational constraints such as the service level and cost budget. We propose a robustness optimization model to tackle these uncertainties; thus we aim to satisfy operational constraints under a reference distribution yet also to protect against ambiguity in the true distribution. This paper is the first, as far as we know, to incorporate various time-dependent uncertainties. We then reformulate the model and efficiently obtain solutions by solving a sequence of mixed-integer linear optimization problems. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our model yields remarkable performance in various settings and is computationally scalable. We find that our model, when compared to such benchmarks as "fluid-based optimization", achieves the highest average service level for a given repositioning cost budget; it also is robust to adverse circumstances (i.e., its worst-case service level is also the highest).},

  abstract = {Sustainable energy systems of the future will no longer be able to rely on the current paradigm that energy supply follows demand. Many of the renewable energy resources do not produce power on demand, and therefore there is a need for new market structures that motivate sustainable behaviors by participants.  The Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC) is a new annual competition that focuses on the design and operation of future retail power markets, specifically in smart grid environments with renewable energy production, smart metering, and autonomous agents acting on behalf of customers and retailers. It uses a rich, open-source simulation platform that is based on real-world data and state-of-the-art customer models. Its purpose is to help researchers understand the dynamics of customer and retailer decision-making, as well as the robustness of proposed market designs. This paper introduces TacTex'13, the champion agent from the inaugural competition in 2013. TacTex'13 learns and adapts to the environment in which it operates, by heavily relying on reinforcement learning and prediction methods. This paper describes the constituent components of TacTex'13 and examines its success through analysis of competition results and subsequent controlled experiments.},

  abstract = {The paper at hand describes a research project conducted in collaboration with a major employer based in Basel, Switzerland. The company employs innovative mobility policies, such as a strict parking regime, with lots only available to employees who have to travel more than 45 minutes by public transport, offers bike sharing and public transport bonuses, but would like to further reduce parking lots and desires to reduce greenhouse emissions resulting from commuting while remaining an attractive employer.  The aim of the project was the to better understand the impact of exogenous developments (e.g. new train lines, road pricing, infrastructure improvements, safer cycling routes) and endogenous mobility policies (e.g. bike sharing, parking fees, charging stations). These developments and policies were identified in a series of workshops with stakeholders. At the same, key performance indicators were formulated.   Instead of forecasting the impact of these policy measures, the project set out to describe a desirable future (e.g., less emissions, attractive employer), reason backwards from the desired situation and formulate a package of policy measures that could in this future, whilst taking into account exogenous developments. This process is also known as backcasting and has been applied in several studies (e.g. Banister et al., 2000; Barandier 2015)  To quantify the impact of the policy measures several data sets were available and newly collected. Travel times and distances for motorized private transport, walking and cycling were calculated using the Google travel time API for all employees. As Google's API only offers limited coverage for public transport in Germany and France, use was made of publicly available public transport schedules and the open-source routing engine R5. A survey was conducted among employees, resulting in over 6000 responses. Based on the survey data, choice models were estimated and applied. Exogenous and endogenous developments for over 10 policy measures were quantified using simplified assumptions, whilst taking into account the spatial differences, and used to forecast the impact of each individual measure and combinations of measures. Measures include the impact of e-bike provision, the impact of improved cycling infrastructure, new train stations and the differentiated parking fees.  The project resulted in a set of mobility policies and recommendations to monitor these mobility policies, and the methodology has been applied at other stakeholders to support sustainable mobility policies.},

  abstract = {In many countries strikes hit the public transport sector from time to time. Public transport strikes are important for transportation research because they can impact upon the perceived reliability of public transport services. Moreover, the traveller's most preferred alternative is removed from the choice set. The traveller is forced to make up his mind about his preferences; doing so may induce a shift from inert, habit-driven behaviour to rational behaviour. In this paper we review 13 studies of strikes in the public transport sector, discuss criteria that determine the kind and size of the effects of a public transport strike, and present the results of a survey carried out after a short, unannounced railway strike in the Netherlands. Our survey confirms the results of other studies. In the short-term mainly captive travellers are affected; these are mostly commuters without alternative modes of transport who are highly inflexible in their departure or arrival times. As a result, on average 10\textendash 20\% of the trips are cancelled. Most travellers switch to the car (either as driver or passenger) and as a result road congestion increases. Longer-term effects include a decrease in market share for public transport, which various studies estimate to be between 0.3 and 2.5\%. The effect of a strike on public transport rider-ship can be temporary or permanent, depending on the type of strike and the policy response to it.},

However, brokers face great challenges, including the varying energy demands of consumers, the changing prices in the markets, and the competitions between each other. This paper proposes an intelligent broker model based on hybrid learning (including unsupervised, supervised and reinforcement learning), which generates smart trading strategies to adapt to the dynamics and complexity of Smart Grid markets. The proposed broker model comprises three interconnected modules. Customer demand prediction module predicts short-term demands of various consumers with a data-driven method. Wholesale market module employs a Markov Decision Process for the one-day-ahead power auction based on the predicted demand. Retail market module introduces independent reinforcement learning processes to optimize prices for different types of consumers to compete with other brokers in the retail market. We evaluate the proposed broker model on Power TAC platform. The experimental results show that our broker is not only is competitive in making profit, but also maintains a good supply-demand balance. In addition, we also discover two empirical laws in the competitive power market environment, which are: 1. profit margin shrinks when there are fierce competitions in markets; 2. the imbalance rate of supply demand increases when the market environment is more competitive.},

In short, the population characteristics of people choosing to use EVS are male, aged between 18 and 30 and usually taking the subway and bus as the daily transportation modes. Otherwise, the factors of the acceptable highest price of EVS, occupation and personal monthly income have significant impacts on the use willingness of people who keep a neutral stance.

  abstract = {As a healthy and environment-friendly trip mode, public bicycle-sharing systems, which have so far been built in hundreds of cities around the world, have been developing rapidly recently. The public bicycle-sharing systems, which are usually spatially embedded where original urban bus transport networks are located, comprise the new urban public transport system together with the bus transport networks. Therefore, studying the impact of the public bicycle-sharing systems on the original urban public transport networks is an important research subject. In this study, using the real spatial location data of the public bicycle-sharing systems of Hangzhou and Ningbo in China, we propose a multi-layer coupling spatial network model that considers the geographical information on bus stations, bus routes, and public bicycle stations by studying the urban public transport networks. The spatial network model consists of bus subnets, short-distance bicycle subnets, and short-distance walk subnets which are interdependent rather than independent. We apply the model to study the influence of bicycling between the short-distance bicycle station pairs (SDB) and walking between the short-distance bus station pairs (SDW) on the performance of the urban public transport networks. Results show that SDB and SDW can significantly reduce the average transfer times, the average path length of passengers' trips and the Gini coefficient of an urban public transport network. Therefore, the public bicycle-sharing systems can decrease the average trip time of passengers and increase the efficiency of an urban public transport network, as well as effectively improve the uneven level of traffic flow spatial distribution of an urban public transport network and will be helpful to smoothening the traffic flow and alleviating traffic congestion.},

This study aims to quantitatively estimate the environmental benefits of bike sharing. Using big data techniques, we estimate the impacts of bike sharing on energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions in Shanghai from a spatiotemporal perspective. In 2016, bike sharing in Shanghai saved 8358 tonnes of petrol and decreased CO2 and NOX emissions by 25,240 and 64\,tonnes, respectively. From a spatial perspective, environmental benefits are much higher in more developed districts in Shanghai where population density is usually higher. From a temporal perspective, there are obvious morning and evening peaks of the environmental benefits of bike sharing, and evening peaks are higher than morning peaks. Bike sharing has great potential to reduce energy consumption and emissions based on its rapid development.},

  abstract = {This study considers a multi-period two-region repositioning problem with setup repositioning costs involved for vehicle sharing systems. We find that incorporating such costs can influence the total cost significantly and complicate the structure of the optimal policy. Moreover, we manage to partially characterize the optimal policy, and then develop an easy-to-implement heuristic policy. The performance of the heuristic policy and the influence of setup repositioning costs on policies are assessed numerically.},
