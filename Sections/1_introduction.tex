"Results show that bicycles significantly reduce the average transfer times, the
average path length of passengersâ€™ trips and the Gini coefficient of an urban
public transport network" \cite{yangImpactPublicBicyclesharing2018}.

Public transport frequency is significantly positively correlated with the number
of bicycle trips, especially short and medium distance trips up to 3 km
\cite{radzimskiExploringRelationshipBikesharing2021a}.

\cite{murphyRoleBicyclesharingCity2015} conduct a questionnaire, which shows
that 39\% of bicycle sharing users (in Dublin) use bicycle sharing in conjunction
with another mode of transport. Of those, 91.5\% use public transport, which
indicates that bicycle sharing is synergetic with public transport.

\cite{fishmanBikeShareSynthesis2013} perform a literature review on bicycle
sharing in general and find that bicycle sharing is synergetic with public
transport.

\cite{maBicycleSharingPublic2015} run a linear regression with data ... in which
the number of passengers of public transport is regressed on the number of
bicycle sharing trips. They find a positive correlation between the two and
conclude that bicycle sharing and public transport are complementary. As a
possible reason for this, they state that bicycle sharing can be used to solve
the first and last mile problem.
